22,"Bride of Chucky is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90 's . ** SPOILERS ** Chucky 's girlfriend , Tiffany ( Jennifer Tilly ) manages to find his battered remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of part 3 and brings him to life in her trailer park . Her neighbor , Jessie ( Nick Stabile ) and his girlfriend Jade ( Katherine Heigl ) are being tormented by her uncle . ( John Ritter ) Tiffany upsets Chucky when he refuses to marry her , so she buys a doll for him to play with . Chucky kills Tiffany , and then transfers her soul into the doll she got him . In order for them to be placed back into human bodies , they have to travel to New Jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so . Jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from Ritter , and they set out on the journey , but not before Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany . Along the way , several bizarre incidents force them to stop at a bed and breakfast . When several more people are killed , they call up their best friend ( Gordon Woolvett ) to straighten out the situation . They convince him neither one of them are the killers , as the police have began to solve the crimes . He finds Ritter 's body in a trunk in the back of the van . Thinking he has been set up , he confronts them about it . Chucky and Tiffany then turn real to prove they did it , which gets Woolvett killed . The group steals a motor home and arrives at the cemetery . Jessie and Jade get Chucky and Tiffany to turn on each other , giving them enough to escape . Chucky recaptures Jade and forces her to get his amulet . Chucky and Tiffany restart their feud , which gives Jessie and Jade enough time to kill the both of them as the police arrive and clears them of the crimes . The Good News : I have to give the most amount of props to the FX department , as Chucky and Tiffany as dolls look completely convincing . The scenes with them together are the movies main highlights , including a hilarious conversation where Tiffany advises Chucky on how serial killers in the 90 's work . That being said , the amount of one-liners in this movie that are actually funny is incredible . Chucky gets the most of them , but Tiffany cracks a few gems as well . It is actually funnier than what Hollywood calls comedies these days . The gore is plentiful and shockingly realistic . Several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative . Turning Ritter into a new form of Pinhead was a totally brilliant scene . The honeymooning couple was a nice death scene , as well . For teenage love , the pairing of Stabile and Heigl works great . They have a great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple . I also have to admit that the first time I saw this movie , I did jump during certain scenes , and that shows what an incredible job director Yu did . He learned enough , apparently , to do the same thing with "" Freddy vs. Jason . "" He knows how to stage set-ups and pay-offs , and here he shows some great skills that have a Hong Kong influenced look and style . He could be the next great horror director if he keeps filling up his resume with films like those two . Nice soundtrack , too , like "" Freddy vs. Jason . "" The Bad News : For fans of cheesy movies , this will be a great find . However , this film has a high cheese factor that may prevent the serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this film . The film knows it is a cheesy movie and revels in it , making a serious fan turned off because of things like the one-liners . It is n't all that bad of a movie , but it has to be watched in the mind frame that it is a cheesy movie , and that the cheesiness of certain scenes add to the movie , not to take it away . Remove yourself from that state of mind and you may find yourself enjoying this movie . The Final Verdict : Fans of cheesy movies and the other "" Child 's Play "" movies will find a lot to like about this movie . For serious horror fans , take a look at it , but keep in mind that it is n't a serious movie and that the cheesiness is supposed to be there and you might find yourself liking it . Rated R : Graphic Violence , Graphic Language , Brief Nudity on a doll , a shadowy puppet sex scene , some drug use , and numerous drug references .

24,"When I typed Savage Intruder into the IMDb 's search engine one of the options it came up with was Savage Garden : International Video Collection : The Story so Far ( 1999 ) , the only reason I mention this is because I 'm a huge Savage Garden fan & you should do yourself a favour & check some of their music out like Affirmation or To the Moon and Back rather than bother with this average pot-boiler , sorry I just wanted to say that . Anyway , Savage Intruder starts with a bizarre montage of what looks like MGM musical & premiere footage & a few spinning portraits which have no meaning whatsoever in the long run . It 's late 60 's Hollywood & amid the glitz & glamour a serial killer is at work selecting ageing actresses , killing them & dismembering their bodies . A young man named Vic Valance ( David Garfield as John David Garfield ) hops off a tour bus looking for employment when it stops at the house of a now retired actress , Katharine Parker ( Miriam Hopkins ) who was ' one of the biggest stars of the motion picture ' but now lives in a big house with an elderly housekeeper named Mildred ( Florence Lake ) , a personal secretary Leslie Blair ( Gale Sondergaard ) & a young maid named Geta ( Virginia Wing ) . Katharine has recently broken her foot & needs a personal assistant & gives Vic the job . Slowly Vic charms his way into Katharine 's affections & more importantly her large wallet . Vic starts to turn Katharine against the other employees , but Vic is n't what he seems . Vic is a drug addicted loon who gets Greta pregnant while still having sex with Katharine . Greta threatens to tell Katharine & spoil Vic 's devious plans but she has a close encounter with an axe , no one in the house is safe as Vic brings drugs , sex , rock 'n' roll party 's & gardening to the Parker mansion while his sinister plan starts to become more & more apparent ... Written , produced & directed by Donald Wolfe I thought Savage Intruder was a bit of a mess but a mildly entertaining one at the same time . The script is all over the place & it ca n't really decide what it wants to be , Savage Intruder suffers from an identity crisis ! The film starts with the discovery of a severed head & limbs , straight after another woman ( Dorothy Kingston ) is killed by a mysterious unidentified figure but then it completely ditches the slasher film elements that it has just built up never going back to them . Savage Intruder then becomes a sort of feel good film as Vic befriends Katharine & shows her how to enjoy life again & having an implied sexual relationship with her , it 's actually disgusting to think about as she 's old enough to be his Grandmother . Katharine stops living the life of a recluse & gives up the alcohol as Vic appears to make her happy as they go to party 's together & hold banquets for Katharine 's friend like she used too . This part of Savage Intruder would n't look out of place in a Disney film ! Every so often the tedium of the feel good stuff is interrupted by Vic shooting up & having silly hallucinations about his Mother ( Sybelle Guardino ) & chopping her hand off with an axe , he has sex with Great at one point as well . Then , after Greta has been murdered , Savage Intruder becomes a bizarre horror film as Vic is revealed for the loony that he is . Savage Intruder just does n't flow properly as a film in my opinion as it mixes various genres with little success . Similarly the murder mystery elements do n't work & are frankly a bit of a puzzle , why go to great lengths to conceal the killers identity during the murder scenes but then make it perfectly clear who is committing them throughout the rest of the film anyway ? Vic as a character did n't work for me either , one moment he 's a cool , calm , clever & devious con man & then next he 's a stark raving loony ! Why kill all his other victims but with Katharine try to con her ? What makes her so different ? If it is because she has money why not go after her to start with ? So many questions & so few answers ... Some of the 60 's dialogue is pretty funny to listen to these days like when Vic offers Greta a painkiller , in reality hard drugs , & Greta says "" what do I need a painkiller for ? "" , Vic helpfully replies "" because your a pain "" wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies ! Or when Katharine suggests that Vic do some gardening & ask 's "" do you have green fingers ? "" he replies "" no , but I 'm good at grass ! "" There is n't much gore in Savage Intruder , some severed limbs & a couple of decapitated heads . There is also a fairly impressive shot when someone has their hand cut off with an axe which is probably why it 's repeated three or four times . The silly looking drug hallucination scenes need to be seen to be believed . Technically Savage Intruder is OK , the location filming in the grandiose mansion & Hollywood hills probably give it a better look than it deserves , the acting is average as is the rest of the production . Overall I 'd say Savage Intruder feels like it tries to be a murder mystery that unfortunately gives the killer away & as a result just does n't work . It 's a mildly entertaining one-time-watch at best & a complete mess of a film at worse , you decide which !

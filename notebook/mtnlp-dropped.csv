22,"Bride of Chucky is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90 's . ** SPOILERS ** Chucky 's girlfriend , Tiffany ( Jennifer Tilly ) manages to find his battered remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of part 3 and brings him to life in her trailer park . Her neighbor , Jessie ( Nick Stabile ) and his girlfriend Jade ( Katherine Heigl ) are being tormented by her uncle . ( John Ritter ) Tiffany upsets Chucky when he refuses to marry her , so she buys a doll for him to play with . Chucky kills Tiffany , and then transfers her soul into the doll she got him . In order for them to be placed back into human bodies , they have to travel to New Jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so . Jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from Ritter , and they set out on the journey , but not before Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany . Along the way , several bizarre incidents force them to stop at a bed and breakfast . When several more people are killed , they call up their best friend ( Gordon Woolvett ) to straighten out the situation . They convince him neither one of them are the killers , as the police have began to solve the crimes . He finds Ritter 's body in a trunk in the back of the van . Thinking he has been set up , he confronts them about it . Chucky and Tiffany then turn real to prove they did it , which gets Woolvett killed . The group steals a motor home and arrives at the cemetery . Jessie and Jade get Chucky and Tiffany to turn on each other , giving them enough to escape . Chucky recaptures Jade and forces her to get his amulet . Chucky and Tiffany restart their feud , which gives Jessie and Jade enough time to kill the both of them as the police arrive and clears them of the crimes . The Good News : I have to give the most amount of props to the FX department , as Chucky and Tiffany as dolls look completely convincing . The scenes with them together are the movies main highlights , including a hilarious conversation where Tiffany advises Chucky on how serial killers in the 90 's work . That being said , the amount of one-liners in this movie that are actually funny is incredible . Chucky gets the most of them , but Tiffany cracks a few gems as well . It is actually funnier than what Hollywood calls comedies these days . The gore is plentiful and shockingly realistic . Several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative . Turning Ritter into a new form of Pinhead was a totally brilliant scene . The honeymooning couple was a nice death scene , as well . For teenage love , the pairing of Stabile and Heigl works great . They have a great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple . I also have to admit that the first time I saw this movie , I did jump during certain scenes , and that shows what an incredible job director Yu did . He learned enough , apparently , to do the same thing with "" Freddy vs. Jason . "" He knows how to stage set-ups and pay-offs , and here he shows some great skills that have a Hong Kong influenced look and style . He could be the next great horror director if he keeps filling up his resume with films like those two . Nice soundtrack , too , like "" Freddy vs. Jason . "" The Bad News : For fans of cheesy movies , this will be a great find . However , this film has a high cheese factor that may prevent the serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this film . The film knows it is a cheesy movie and revels in it , making a serious fan turned off because of things like the one-liners . It is n't all that bad of a movie , but it has to be watched in the mind frame that it is a cheesy movie , and that the cheesiness of certain scenes add to the movie , not to take it away . Remove yourself from that state of mind and you may find yourself enjoying this movie . The Final Verdict : Fans of cheesy movies and the other "" Child 's Play "" movies will find a lot to like about this movie . For serious horror fans , take a look at it , but keep in mind that it is n't a serious movie and that the cheesiness is supposed to be there and you might find yourself liking it .

Anyway , Savage Intruder starts with a bizarre montage of what looks like MGM musical & premiere footage & a few spinning portraits which have no meaning whatsoever in the long run . It 's late 60 's Hollywood & amid the glitz & glamour a serial killer is at work selecting ageing actresses , killing them & dismembering their bodies . A young man named Vic Valance ( David Garfield as John David Garfield ) hops off a tour bus looking for employment when it stops at the house of a now retired actress , Katharine Parker ( Miriam Hopkins ) who was ' one of the biggest stars of the motion picture ' but now lives in a big house with an elderly housekeeper named Mildred ( Florence Lake ) , a personal secretary Leslie Blair ( Gale Sondergaard ) & a young maid named Geta ( Virginia Wing ) .

Greta threatens to tell Katharine & spoil Vic 's devious plans but she has a close encounter with an axe , no one in the house is safe as Vic brings drugs , sex , rock 'n' roll party 's & gardening to the Parker mansion while his sinister plan starts to become more & more apparent ... Written , produced & directed by Donald Wolfe I thought Savage Intruder was a bit of a mess but a mildly entertaining one at the same time . The script is all over the place & it ca n't really decide what it wants to be , Savage Intruder suffers from an identity crisis ! The film starts with the discovery of a severed head & limbs , straight after another woman ( Dorothy Kingston ) is killed by a mysterious unidentified figure but then it completely ditches the slasher film elements that it has just built up never going back to them .

Katharine stops living the life of a recluse & gives up the alcohol as Vic appears to make her happy as they go to party 's together & hold banquets for Katharine 's friend like she used too . This part of Savage Intruder would n't look out of place in a Disney film ! Every so often the tedium of the feel good stuff is interrupted by Vic shooting up & having silly hallucinations about his Mother ( Sybelle Guardino ) & chopping her hand off with an axe , he has sex with Great at one point as well . Then , after Greta has been murdered , Savage Intruder becomes a bizarre horror film as Vic is revealed for the loony that he is . Savage Intruder just does n't flow properly as a film in my opinion as it mixes various genres with little success .

385,"This film flopped miserably in the UK , and it did n't deserve to . The trailer of this film is slightly misleading , and I guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was "" Atonement : Part 2 "" . While the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of Joe Wright 's BAFTA-winning film , it 's very different in tone . It focuses on an imagination of sorts of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas ' life during the Second World War as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort , and his subsequent return to Wales . Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan 's ( Matthew Ryhs ) childhood sweetheart Vera Phillips , played by Keira Knightley . She was Dylan 's first love in their homeland , but the moment has passed , and singer Vera only wants it as a beautiful memory . Or does she ? Vera unexpectedly strikes up a close bond with the other woman in Dylan 's life , "" Queen of Ireland , love of my life , mother of my child "" Caitlin Thomas ( Sienna Miller ) . The three form a sort of menage a trois in war-struck London , but Vera then falls for a dashing soldier , William Killick ( Cillian Murphy ) . They quickly marry , with Killick leaving for War . A frightened Vera convinces the Thomas ' to return witb her to Wales , but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of Vera 's child , William 's jealousy and shell-shock after returning home , and Caitlin realising she can not share Dylan with her best friend .

386,"The third entry in the "" Stepford "" franchise , but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down , whereas the 70 's original as well as the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular . I have n't seen either the early 80 's "" Revenge of the Stepford Wives "" or the mid 90 's "" The Stepford Husbands "" , but this "" The Stepford Children "" is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film . It 's basically the exact same film as the original ; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80 's to the nth degree . The main difference here , like the title implies , is that not just the liberated wives but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring in town undergoes the typical and highly effective "" Stepford treatment "" , licensed by the local Men 's Association . For some reason the scenario attempts to uphold the Stepford mystery until late in the film , even though nobody is likely to watch this sequel before having checked out the original and presumably everybody also knows about the denouement . The Harding family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford . Particularly father Steven is excited about their new life because he already lived in Stepford and always wanted to go back ever since his first wife , whom his new wife Laura and adolescent children Mary and David know very little about , died under mysterious circumstances . The town is almost too perfect , with picturesque neighbors and model students , and especially the modern teenagers face huge difficulties to adjust . Their efforts to modernize the place and take the local youth of Stanford in tow cause confrontations with the eminent townsfolk , particularly the members of the Men 's Association , and put the familial relationships under a lot of stress . David meets and falls in love with the last "" normal "" girl in school Lois , but when even she transforms into a domestic dummy overnight , David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the sinister Stanford secret . The first hour of "" The Stanford Children "" is slow-paced and rather tame , but the finale is trashy and cheesy like the VHS cover promises and like a late 80 's thriller ought to be , in fact . The modus operandi behind the Stanford secrets is illustrated in greater detail , and I think horror fans and lovers of the original film will appreciate that . At least , I did . The overall plot still does n't make a lot of sense and the script is chock-full of irrational aspects , but it 's nonetheless an engaging formula and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear . The acting performances are far above average . Especially the arrogant and obnoxious members of the Men 's Association depict plausible characters and even teenage players Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff give away impressive performances .

The joint 's lonely , seemingly friendless and harmless owner Slausen ( juicily overplayed with infectiously hammy brio by Chuck Conners ) turns out to be a deranged psychic killer with lethal telekinetic powers . Slausen brings his freaky assortment of uncomfortably human-like mannequins to life and picks off the kids one by one so he can add them to his ever-growing collection of victims . Director David ( "" Puppermaster , "" "" The Arrival "" ) Schmoeller adeptly wrings every last ounce of tension he can squeeze from the pleasingly ambiguous and open-ended script he co-wrote with J. Larry Carroll . ( Said script 's stubborn refusal to provide some rational excuse for all the bizarre stuff which transpires throughout the movie , often wrongly criticized as one of the film 's principal weaknesses , is actually the movie 's key strength , giving the picture the scary , anything-and-everything-can-happen , common-logic-be-damned quality of a true nightmare come horrifically to life which never would have been achieved if there was some kind of credible explanation offered for what 's happening . ) Pino Donaggio 's beautifully chilling , understated score , Nicholas von Sternberg 's shadowy cinematography , and Robert A. Burns ' grubby , cramped production design add immensely to the film 's profoundly unsettling mood . Excellent performances are another significant plus , with the pretty , perky Jocelyn Jones ( Ellie-Jo Turner in "" The Great Texas Dynamite Chase "" ) particularly fine and personable as the most resilient and sympathetic of the endangered teens . Even Tanya Roberts fares well as a luckless lad who has a knife levitated into her head . Offbeat and unusual , "" Tourist Trap "" is well worth visiting . ",,
395,"I wrote spoiler alert , but there 's not really much that can be spoiled . It 's like spoiling rotten meat . This movie is probably the worst I 've ever seen . Not because of the actors or the special effects , but because of the sheer number of mistakes , both factual and physical . First of all , the MIGs are n't actually MIGs at all . They 're Mirages , and they 're French . And how the heck can Doug 's dad withstand the maneuvers his son makes to fight off the "" MIGs "" without a g-suit ? And why would Chappy try to board his plane without a g-suit ? And how could Doug defeat the enemy pilot ace with such ease ? Anyway , I did not like this movie . And the worst part is that it has 3 sequels , the latest one from as late as 1995 . Now that 's scary . ","I wrote spoiler alert , but there 's not really much that can be spoiled .

396,"I actually went into this film with some expectations , not because I thought the film sounded particularly good , but because I 'm a fan of Italian exploitation flicks and with a cast that sees Franco Nero and Telly Savalas starring alongside Oliver Twist , I figured it had to be interesting at least . Well ... RedNeck does have one or two positive things going on , but for the most part ; it 's a dull , lifeless film that is as ridiculous as it is pointless . The plot simply focuses on two criminals ( Nero and Savalas ) who kidnap a young kid ( Oliver ) . The twist in the tale is that the kid realises that he 'd have more fun if he gets accepted into the ' gang ' . Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors that have proved they can carry a film on their own on numerous occasions , and they do have some memorable moments in this film - although really for all the wrong reasons . Savalas in particular gives a silly portrayal of the ' bad ' criminal . The plot does n't flow badly , but since nothing interesting happens , that 's not really a positive point and does n't save from the film from being mediocre . Overall , I ca n't recommend this film ; it may appeal to some for its cult value but it did n't do anything for me .

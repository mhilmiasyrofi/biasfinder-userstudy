0,"Four Daughters introduced John Garfield to audiences , and that is what is remembered most about this film today . Unlike some actors who appear in several films before their screen image gels , Garfield established his immediately , with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and talk of the fates being against him . It 's actually the story of four girls , their widowed musician father ( Claude Rains ) and their various suitors , one of whom , Felix , is played by handsome Jeffrey Lynn . He 's the one they all have a crush on , but he 's in love with Buff ( Priscilla Lane ) . Then she meets ne'er - do-well Mickey Borden , who falls for her as well . When Buff realizes that one of her sisters is in love with Felix , she leaves him at the altar and marries Mickey . This is a fairly formulaic story given life ( and sequels ) by the acting . Garfield has already been mentioned , but Priscilla Lane was by far the strongest of the daughters , the most interesting , and the best actress . Jeffrey Lynn was a fresh and good-looking leading man , and this film got him off on the right foot with Warners . However , true stardom was not to be . Like many others of the era , he went into the service , and when he came out , he had a Bronze Star but not much of a career . He later went into television and real estate . Claude Rains is warm and wonderful as the patriarch . So popular was "" Four Daughters "" that it inspired "" Four Wives "" and "" Four Mothers , "" as well as reuniting much of the cast again in "" Daughters Courageous "" where the actors played different characters . Very enjoyable , a nice remembrance of simpler and probably happier times , and a chance to see John Garfield in his first film .

1,"I 've already seen spin-offs of cartoons such as The Flintstones , Scooby Doo , Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes and most of them are great . When I saw the All Grown Up pilot in 2001 , I thought it was interesting to see how the Rugrats would look in their pre-teens/teens and it contained things that would usually happen during that time of life such as going to a concert , going to school and being grounded . The actual TV show is better because the Rugrats seem to wear different clothes in each episode and Angelica does n't get punished as much as she did in the original Rugrats series . Tommy and Susie get punished in this series . I 've also noticed references to Rugrats in this show and even flashbacks of how the Rugrats looked in the original series . They actually talk to the adults in this show because they 're 10 years older . This show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats .

3,"If anyone has any doubts about the talent of Liev Schrieber , just a look at his new film , "" Everything is Illuminated "" , which clearly shows a man that is not only one of America 's finest actors , but a new director whose first effort is indeed an inspiration and a harbinger of what is to follow . Mr. Schreiber has adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer into a film that will live forever because of the way the director has adapted the material . The film clearly surpassed our expectations since we had no preconceived ideas . For those who have n't watched the film , perhaps you should stop reading here . Jonathan is a collector . His love for his grandparents is boundless . He watches as his grandfather dies and as his grandmother is on what appears to be her death bed . On a clear moment , this dying woman gives Jonathan a picture and an amber ornament for his collection . Watching the photograph , taken a long time ago , a young couple are seen together . Watching makes Jonathan think it shows the grandfather and his girlfriend , taken on happier times . Watching the snapshot seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to go looking for his ancestors ' past in the Ukraine . Jonathan has made arrangements with a travel agency , Heritage Tours , of Odessa for his trip to Trochenbrod , the mythical place where his grandfather came from . The agency is handled by an older man , who claims to be blind , and his grandson , Alex , a man who loves the pop American culture that has captured his imagination , as well as his contemporaries in the country . Alex speaks a kind of English no one speaks and his conversation and translation , for Jonathan 's benefit are hilarious to our ear for the use of sometimes unheard English terms . The old man insists in taking his dog , Sammy Davis Jr. , against the wishes of Jonathan , who does n't want to sit next to the snarling and barking animal during the trip . As they embark in search of Trochenbrod , it 's clearly that his companions , especially the old man has no clue where he is going . At this point , the film becomes a road movie , as the three characters riding the back roads of the country become more acquainted with one another . As the trio arrive at the sunflower field with the house at the end , it indicates they have indeed come to the right place . Some places are a clear reminder of the conflicts of the past . The older woman , living in the isolated place , is the missing link of the story . She is able to put things into the right perspective . But here is where the story changes its emphasis from Jonathan , who clearly has come to the land of his ancestors , to the old man . We watch as this older man starts remembering things about himself . This , in turn , changes the dynamic of the film as we discover how connected Jonathan and his guides have been all the time . Some criticism in these pages have expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story , which after all , it 's a work of fiction and liberties have been taken . It would have been impossible to make another film including so much that is contained in the book . The great way the film is divided into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what 's about to be seen . Elijah Wood , a magnificent film actor , does an excellent work by underplaying Jonathan . Mr. Wood makes one of his best appearances in any film with his interpretation of the main character . The felicitous casting of Eugene Hutz as Alex , the Ukranian tour assistant and translator , seems to be an idea made in heaven . Mr. Hutz is about the best thing in the film . His arcane usage of English gives the film a funny angle that delights the viewer . Boris Leskin as Alex 's grandfather and driver of the tour car makes a valuable contribution to the film , as well as Laryssa Lauret , who is seen in the last part of the movie . The excellent cinematography of Matthew Libatique brings the splendor of the Czech Republic 's countryside in all its magnificence . The musical score by Paul Cantelon is heard in the background adorning the film in ways that it adds a richness to the movie . Above all , this is a triumph for Liev Schreiber , the first time director that will surely go far in whatever he decides to do next .

6,"This is s superbly crafted top-notch Washington thriller directed by the talented Wolfgang Petersen with hotshot screenwriter Jeff Maguire ( who seems to have done very little over the years , so maybe he tends his roses ) . The film has Clint Eastwood as an ageing secret service agent and John Malkovich as a vengeful assassin pitted against each other in a massive test of wills and ingenuity , where the President 's life is at stake . Unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies almost dooms the President , which is an authentic touch . This film was made when both Eastwood and Malkovich were at their peak . Probably Eastwood has never done a better job than he does here , and it is all so effortless for the old pro . There are some wonderful sound effects of him huffing and puffing as he runs along beside the President 's car as a bodyguard , for which he is too old . I wonder if anyone else noticed the humour of those noises having been added . My ' guardian angel ' , whose name is Vigil , enjoyed this movie even more than I did , but then bodyguard movies are very much his thing . Rene Russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who falls for Eastwood , as she is so unobvious but so talented , and she shines . The tension is taut every inch of the way in this story , and the psychological struggles of Eastwood to redeem himself from an earlier protection failure are beautifully shown by his typical understated acting . With Eastwood , if he lifts an eyebrow by a millimeter , watch out ! Of course , he is the master of the super-cool .

7,"This review is long overdue , since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made . I 'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay , cinematography , acting , post-production , editing , directing , or any other aspect of film-making . It 's practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "" masterpieces . "" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema . I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute . Quite literally , Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels . A seemingly insignificant object may be shown a rack of dresses , two diaries , a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack , a bottle of pills , etc . but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene ( or perhaps the movie in total ) , which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer 's intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront . Such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie , but in A Tale of Two Sisters such events occur in such a rapid-fire , relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness , lest they miss something important . In other words , the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films . How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this ? It 's quite simply the highest , most superlative form of cinema imaginable . The most commonly cited criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is nicely summarized by Zaphod B Goode , who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent , unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions . He posits that Ji-woon Kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that . In reality , however , nothing could be further from the truth . A Tale of Two Sisters provides a series of unassailably objective facts that help the viewer to identify the EXACT occurrences of each and every scene of the film . If our good friend Zaphod had been paying attention , he would have noticed for example the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film . These flashbacks convincingly contradict Zaphod 's assertion of complete subjectivity . The objective elements of A Tale of Two Sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them . Can Ji-woon Kim really be faulted for the impatience of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film ? I think not . Please note that I will not insult the intelligence of critics such as Zaphod that can not "" get "" A Tale of Two Sisters , because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of persistence . The movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer . Yes , this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving , but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture . You need only put them together . Remember , the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind he simply separated the pieces and placed them skillfully throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that when completed bestows an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe . Do n't misunderstand me . There are films that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design . Spider Forest ( 2004 ) , Perfect Blue ( 1998 ) and Donnie Darko ( 2001 ) are perfect examples of this . A Tale of Two Sisters is not . It 's ironic that Zaphod claims Darko to be more masterfully constructed than A Tale of Two Sisters , especially considering that Darko not only provides almost NO objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential deus ex machina cliché that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence . I 'm ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence , but the contrast is an important one . Although it does perplex me that Zaphod would cite a movie that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of criticizing a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant application of intellectual effort . He apparently likes his "" intelligent "" films in the most superficial form possible . This is evident when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself . Just read the threads by Opiemar within the IMDb A Tale of Two Sisters Discussion Forum . Anyone who carefully reads those threads and still asserts a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned OBVIOUS . I 'd like to say more , but I 've come to my 1,000 word limit . All that has been said here needed to be said . So be it now said ! ","This review is long overdue , since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made . I 'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay , cinematography , acting , post-production , editing , directing , or any other aspect of film-making . It 's practically perfect in all of them a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "" masterpieces . "" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema . I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute . Quite literally , Ji-woon Kim seems to have made a movie that practically taunts the viewer to dissect it on the most detailed of levels . A seemingly insignificant object may be shown a rack of dresses , two diaries , a drop of blood emanating from a floor crack , a bottle of pills , etc . but upon meticulous inspection turns out to be so much more a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene ( or perhaps the movie in total ) , which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that lurk in the background until the viewer 's intelligence prompts them to spring to the forefront . Such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie , but in A Tale of Two Sisters such events occur in such a rapid-fire , relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a perpetual state of alertness , lest they miss something important . In other words , the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films . How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this ? It 's quite simply the highest , most superlative form of cinema imaginable . The most commonly cited criticism of A Tale of Two Sisters is nicely summarized by Zaphod B Goode , who falsely claims that the story is an incoherent , unresolved mess that uses confusion to instill a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions .

It 's a shame the rest of the movie does n't maintain the level of creepiness exemplified during that scene . This is one of the most frustrating movies ever . Imagine the producers deciding to to make an EXORCIST copy but while making it , they actually succeed in creating something truly original ( a possessed sculpture of crucified man , which is shocking when you think about it ) but then completely forgets their original idea in order to make a boring and uninspired EXORCIST rip-off . Had the film continued with the possessed sculpture concept ( with the characters trying to destroy it , etc ) , this film would have rocked . But once the girl becomes possessed by the spirit of the sculpture , she never tells anyone from where the demon came from . She , and the script , completely forgets the haunted crucifix , which is STUPID !!! If you like so-called "" Euro-cult "" movies , the first 45 minutes deliver unlike any other Euro-cult movies . But after the scene when the girl has a vision of being crucified and she gets stigmatas , the remaining 45 minutes SUCK . Boring .

14,"Tia Carrere was the reason I decided to watch this film , as neither the title , nor the cover would have been enough to make me spend my time and money on this film which goes to show , me and everyone , that a DVD should n't be judged by it 's cover . *** SPOILERS *** The film felt like it was trundling along , not really going anywhere for the moment the awkwardness of Paul Faber ( Zak Orth ) around girls being almost too embarrassing to watch , and the fringe on the otherwise attractive Kirsten Beck ( as Alexondra Lee ) being too school-girlish to watch . Where those really fashionable in 1995 ? The relationship between Vicky Mueller ( Tia Carrere ) and Todd Boomer ( Jason London ) was tantalising from the start of though ! That first meeting across the lake magical . What a beautiful coincidence they should meet again just as he has behaved like a complete moron ( "" Boomer , with two O 's as in moron "" ) in front of Alexondra . A shame really that we as the audience knew who Vicky Mueller really was . ( Well the title did give that away , would n't you think ? ) What really surprised me was the acting . Especially in the scene where Vicky gives Todd a metal version of his alter ego ( the dog character ) , in the little white jewellery box . The actors really managed to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss point of no return for Todd and Vicky . A shame really that the film ends with focus on ( after getting over Todd 's fathers Harvard drive ) his re-uniting with his friends . I could envision a whole new film following Vicky to New York there must be a good art University there that Todd could attend ?!? Nevertheless , a film that does just what we want Hollywood to : entertain us for the duration of the film . Did anyone else notice how none of the loves are happy ones in this film ? Todd 's mother is slightly insane ( on the phone 24/7 ) , his Dad does n't find her attractive ( any more ? ) Todd 's teacher obviously is disenchanted by his wife and vice versa Todd himself enters into a wonderfully erotic & daring relationship which , however nice it may be , would realistically be very difficult to maintain ( age difference , maturity difference etc ) , and Alexondra & Zak do not get together because Alexondra is not mature enough to handle a relationship ( - > her reactions towards the condom , the cheating , Zak 's advances etc. are all very immature , and often involve running away ) , and Zak himself , the poor guy is too much of a best friend/like a brother-guy to pull even Alexondra . Mind you , good film though ! I gave it an 8/10 . Brilliant performance by the actors - who bring the script to life .

21,"Corniness Warning . As many fellow IMDb users already know , I 'm not a corny , cheesy person . If you do n't want to read this kind of review , then go . To tell you the truth , you 're hearing this from a man who laughed through Titanic and almost broke his parents ' tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene . --- Spoilers --- One day , I went off to the theatres with two friends to see Dickie Roberts : Former Child Star , last year in August . The boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly . It was for Radio . The moment I saw the trailer , I just had to see this movie on opening weekend . When that weekend rolled along , Scary Movie 3 was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that Friday night . It turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie , they went and also sold out Good Boy and Radio . I could n't get a ticket and the following weeks , I was busy with more important things . About 5 months later , my friend rented Radio . He let me borrow it and I watched it in my room . I 'll tell you this now , this is the ONLY movie I have ever seen that got me crying EVER . When Radio 's mother died , it just came out automatically . The next day , I went off to Blockbuster and bought the DVD . Well enough of my stupid personal story , let me tell you about the movie . Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally challenged man nick-named Radio . Ed Harris co-stars and this movie is directed by Mike Tollin . Based on a true story , Radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone . He goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around . He 's got his own collection . At the end of every day , he goes home to his mother . He never went to school until later in the film . One day , Radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing . A football flies over the fence and Radio picks it up and continues on . Ed Harris plays Mr. Jones , the football coach . They meet and this is the life of Radio . Throughout the whole movie , Radio and Coach Jones spend quality time together , both teaching each other things . It is beautiful to see how the movie goes to the highest joys , the lowest lows , and just seeing Radio live his life . You will laugh , cry , and live the life of Radio with him . This movie holds a special place in my heart along with Toy Story and others . This is a must-see for the whole family , by yourself , or if you 're someone who just wants a great drama . Radio is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen . Radio will never be forgotten by me . Never . As Ed Harris ' character said greatly near the end of the movie : "" We 're not teaching Radio , Radio is teaching us . "" My Rating : 8/10 Eliason A. ","Corniness Warning . As many fellow IMDb users already know , I 'm not a corny , cheesy person . If you do n't want to read this kind of review , then go . To tell you the truth , you 're hearing this from a <replaced> who laughed through Titanic and almost broke his parents ' tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene . --- Spoilers --- One day , I went off to the theatres with two friends to see Dickie Roberts : Former Child Star , last year in August . The boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly . It was for Radio . The moment I saw the trailer , I just had to see this movie on opening weekend . When that weekend rolled along , Scary Movie 3 was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that Friday night . It turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie , they went and also sold out Good Boy and Radio . I could n't get a ticket and the following weeks , I was busy with more important things . About 5 months later , my friend rented Radio . He let me borrow it and I watched it in my room . I 'll tell you this now , this is the ONLY movie I have ever seen that got me crying EVER . When Radio 's mother died , it just came out automatically .

23,"A harrowing masterpiece on the sheer madness and despair of war , Fires on the Plain ( Nobi ) is not going to be to everybody 's taste : this is a war movie in the truest possible sense of the term , one that resorts neither to flag-waving patriotism nor saccharine sentimentality . Nobi cuts deep , it 's ugly , tenebrous and bleak as few things ever committed on celluloid will ever be . This is war behind the cannons , with no triumphs or heroes , no moral victories or defeats to be had , just a handful of gaunt and terrible-looking men strewn across a land ravaged by war like penitents fleeing a great disaster . The characters defy moral judgment because they are creatures beset by a great woe , a woe that does not permit questions of a moral nature . War and survival . Pitting one 's will against the other 's in a battlefield arena . The loser is simply removed from existence . Tamura , soldier in the Japanese Imperial army , is discharged from his platoon and ordered to report in a nearby hospital on account of him coughing blood and being disliked by the rest of the platoon . He 's told to never come back and instead commit suicide by hand grenade in case the hospital rejects him . Which it does . The hospital is nothing but a shack made of wooden planks and the hospital surgeon simply tells him that if he 's capable of walking he 's just fine . It is in that shabby excuse of a hospital that one of the most harrowing scenes of the film takes place . As the area is carpet bombed by American planes the doctors and those who can walk and sustain themselves flee from the hospital and into the woods . Moments before the hospital is blown to pieces , the gaunt and crippled figures of the sick and injured crawl out of it in every manner of posture , dressed in their sickly white robes , as if the building is some kind of beast spewing viscera and filth out upon the earth . That is Nobi 's greatest success ; the stark and brooding depiction of the suffering of war in simple but evocative images , without melodrama or pseudo-heroism . Soldiers cross a marsh , wading knee-deep in mud , move across the opposite bank and into a field only to discover enemy tanks hiding in the woods , their lights shining like malignant eyes as they scan the dark . A procession of injured soldiers , dirty and half-mad , crossing a road , dropping to the ground on the sound of enemy planes . Buzzards feasting on a pile of dead bodies . An abandoned village . A mad soldier that believes himself to be Buddha sitting under a tree , covered with flies and his own excrement , offering his arm to be eaten by Tamura when he 's dead . These are the images Kon Ichikawa conjures for our eyes , merciless and unflinching in their poignancy but honest and raw . Nobi does n't rush to get somewhere . It is content to follow Tamura 's travels through the war-torn land as he tries to reach the regrouping center of Palompa , and observe the madness and obscenities of war . The movie wades through the sludge of the horror of war , slow and brooding , just like the characters it follows . The final thirty minutes with Tamura taking refuge with two deserters who feed on ' monkey meat ' are the closest Nobi comes to adhering to conventional narratives and they 're no less powerful for that matter . Strikingly photographed in black and white , with great performances from the cast , and Ichikawa 's assured direction , Nobi is not only among the best war movies to be made but also among the finest of Japanese cinema .

26,"This film grabbed me right from its start , where a sweet-looking teen-aged girl is shown visiting a grave alone , then Elton John 's powerful song "" Friends "" starts playing while she 's shown walking alone through the streets of Paris , carrying a suitcase , naively unaware of the car theft and prostitution going on around her . The entire film is a beautiful , dreamy , romantic collection of scenes of young love , holding hands , living in the country , wild horses running around freely , fields of wildflowers , sunsets , toasts of wine , evenings by the fireside , having fun , and general innocence , all set to romantic music by Elton John . It 's magical . Somehow I missed seeing this film when I was growing up . I 'm sure it would have left a strong impression on me if I had seen it then . I remember the radio advertisement for the movie in 1971 , talking about how it was a special movie with music by Elton John , and with the chorus of the theme song "" Friends "" playing in the ad ( "" Makin ' friends for the world to see ... "" ) , but I never heard anything else about it in those days , and never got to see it until I rented it 35 years later from a video store . By then it had been edited , censored , and all kinds of unhappy people with angry political agendas were using all kinds of ugly words to describe the film . What can I say ? The world has gone insane since then . The story is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to move in with her cousin in Paris after both her parents die . ( It was their grave she was visiting in the opening scene . ) One day while visiting the zoo alone she meets a 15-year-old boy , they hit it off , and agree to meet the next day . The next day while riding together the boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a freakish solo car accident . It was his father 's car , he ca n't bear to go back home to face his father 's wrath , so the two teenagers begin living in the French countryside together , with the mutual background that they both hated their lives at home . They settle into an unoccupied cottage , the boy takes odd jobs to support themselves , their supposed friendship turns into romance , the girl becomes pregnant , and they successfully have a baby at home . All the while the boy 's father has the police attempting to locate his missing son . On the 1-year anniversary of the couple 's flight together , the police finally locate the boy 's employer by an in-person inquiry , and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work . The next morning the boy is shown leaving his cottage to go to work , saying a sweet farewell to his girlfriend/wife , and happily doing cartwheels as the scene freezes on his girlfriend waving goodbye . At least that 's how the video version I saw ends . It 's an unexpected though well-timed ending , presumably depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents ' home and his happy life with his wife and baby is shattered . As beautiful as the story and images are , the plot is awfully unrealistic and highly contrived . I think it 's better just to enjoy the movie as a young person 's dream-come-true fantasy and to go no further in analysis , because all logic and believability quickly fall apart when the story is examined in more depth . Why would a fully furnished and stocked cottage be left unattended with the door unlocked and unvisited for a full year ? What did they plan to do when the owners returned ? Why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant from him ? Did n't they think it was unethical to use other people 's homes and food ? How could they ever hope to get needed dental care or other emergency medical attention while living outside of society ? How could the boy have a car accident on a country road with no collision and no other cars around ? Where are there places anywhere near civilization where wild horses run free ? How is it that a teenage male would not have sex as the primary thing on his mind when he picks up a girl at a zoo ? ( The Elton John song lyrics just do n't fit . ) Why would they take off clothes when sleeping outside at night when it 's about to get cold ? And so on . The scenes of wild horses are contrived to appeal to girls , as is the unrealistic theme of "" friendship before romance , "" and all the back-washing and tickling scenes with their predictable outcomes , the running through flower fields towards each other , the haze filters , the scenes shot through wildflowers in the foreground , the baby ducks , and so on . It works , but it 's definitely contrived . Still , this is a movie about youth and freedom , and that ideal has n't changed since the 1970s . Young people today are still treated as belongings or as lost pets to be recovered by the police instead of treated as mature human beings who have the same needs of romantic love and freedom as does the adult world , and the ability to be responsible when given that freedom . Therefore the message is universal . It 's clear why a sequel would n't work : this story is about a magical , year-long reprieve from the real world . Such a situation could never have been extended indefinitely , assuming that it could even happen in the first place , and a story about real life afterward would lack the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence . I really hope that no teenagers took the film seriously enough to try such a foolish stunt . But I hope equally well that teenagers who were impressed by this film in the '70s learned something from it , and have since then made attempts to make such a magical world a more attainable reality for others , instead of perpetuating society 's various hatreds and repressions , especially on their own children . ","This film grabbed me right from its start , where a sweet-looking teen-aged girl is shown visiting a grave alone , then Elton John 's powerful song "" Friends "" starts playing while she 's shown walking alone through the streets of Paris , carrying a suitcase , naively unaware of the car theft and prostitution going on around her . The entire film is a beautiful , dreamy , romantic collection of scenes of young love , holding hands , living in the country , wild horses running around freely , fields of wildflowers , sunsets , toasts of wine , evenings by the fireside , having fun , and general innocence , all set to romantic music by Elton John . It 's magical . Somehow I missed seeing this film when I was growing up . I 'm sure it would have left a strong impression on me if I had seen it then . I remember the radio advertisement for the movie in 1971 , talking about how it was a special movie with music by Elton John , and with the chorus of the theme song "" Friends "" playing in the ad ( "" Makin ' friends for the world to see ... "" ) , but I never heard anything else about it in those days , and never got to see it until I rented it 35 years later from a video store . By then it had been edited , censored , and all kinds of unhappy people with angry political agendas were using all kinds of ugly words to describe the film . What can I say ? The world has gone insane since then . The story is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to move in with her cousin in Paris after both her parents die . ( It was their grave she was visiting in the opening scene . ) One day while visiting the zoo alone she meets a 15-year-old boy , they hit it off , and agree to meet the next day . The next day while riding together the boy accidentally drives his car into a lake in a freakish solo car accident . It was his father 's car , he ca n't bear to go back home to face his father 's wrath , so the two teenagers begin living in the French countryside together , with the mutual background that they both hated their lives at home . They settle into an unoccupied cottage , the boy takes odd jobs to support themselves , their supposed friendship turns into romance , the girl becomes pregnant , and they successfully have a baby at home . All the while the boy 's father has the police attempting to locate his missing son . On the 1-year anniversary of the couple 's flight together , the police finally locate the boy 's employer by an in-person inquiry , and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he comes to work . The next morning the boy is shown leaving his cottage to go to work , saying a sweet farewell to his girlfriend/wife , and happily doing cartwheels as the scene freezes on his girlfriend waving goodbye . At least that 's how the video version I saw ends . It 's an unexpected though well-timed ending , presumably depicting the last moments of bliss before the boy is taken back to his parents ' home and his happy life with his wife and baby is shattered . As beautiful as the story and images are , the plot is awfully unrealistic and highly contrived . I think it 's better just to enjoy the movie as a young person 's dream-come-true fantasy and to go no further in analysis , because all logic and believability quickly fall apart when the story is examined in more depth . Why would a fully furnished and stocked cottage be left unattended with the door unlocked and unvisited for a full year ? What did they plan to do when the owners returned ? Why would a girl trust a car thief enough to get pregnant from him ? Did n't they think it was unethical to use other people 's homes and food ? How could they ever hope to get needed dental care or other emergency medical attention while living outside of society ? How could the boy have a car accident on a country road with no collision and no other cars around ? Where are there places anywhere near civilization where wild horses run free ? How is it that a teenage male would not have sex as the primary thing on his mind when he picks up a girl at a zoo ? ( The Elton John song lyrics just do n't fit . ) Why would they take off clothes when sleeping outside at night when it 's about to get cold ? And so on . The scenes of wild horses are contrived to appeal to girls , as is the unrealistic theme of "" friendship before romance , "" and all the back-washing and tickling scenes with their predictable outcomes , the running through flower fields towards each other , the haze filters , the scenes shot through wildflowers in the foreground , the baby ducks , and so on . It works , but it 's definitely contrived . Still , this is a movie about youth and freedom , and that ideal has n't changed since the 1970s . Young people today are still treated as belongings or as lost pets to be recovered by the police instead of treated as mature human beings who have the same needs of romantic love and freedom as does the adult world , and the ability to be responsible when given that freedom . Therefore the message is universal . It 's clear why a sequel would n't work : this story is about a magical , year-long reprieve from the real world . Such a situation could never have been extended indefinitely , assuming that it could even happen in the first place , and a story about real life afterward would lack the magical appeal of such an unreal state of existence .

27,"I can only guess that this movie was an experiment that misfired . Years earlier , it would have been moving images accompanied by music . Later , it would have been sound added to silents . Eventually it would have been Technicolor , Cinemascope or Imax . This movie must have been a misguided attempt to introduce a new element to the talking picture . During all the emotional scenes , the character stops in mid dialogue and their inner thoughts are narrated while they gaze off into the distance or appeal to the camera . This interruption is painful at it 's very least . Imagine these top tier actors trying to look busy while the narration drones on . Painful . I have no idea who came up with this gimmick , but it was the only time I ever saw it used - and for good reason . In every scene the actors were forced to roll their eyes , wring their hands , or overact to such a degree , I actually wondered if this was really a comedy . The story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over a couple of generations . Norma Shearer , disappointed in love , searches for a reason to live . She has a friend , played by Ralph Morgan , who worships her - but she takes him for granted . She is attracted to a doctor , played by Clark Gable , but he is self absorbed and is n't interested in her . She settles for a weakling that needs her desperately .

28,"Daisy Movie Review By James Mudge From beyondhollywood.com On paper , "" Daisy "" sounds like an Asian film fan 's dream come true , directed by "" Infernal Affairs "" co-helmer Andrew Lau and starring everybody 's favourite sassy girl , popular Korean actress Jeon Ji Hyun . Unfortunately , despite the talent involved , and the fact that the crew flew halfway around the world to shoot in Amsterdam , the film turns out to be a bit of a disappointment , being a clich 'd romantic drama which wallows in misery and self importance . The plot follows Hye Young ( Jeon Ji Hyun ) , a rather naive Korean girl who lives in Amsterdam , spending her life working in her grandfather 's antique shop and doing portraits for tourists . One day , she begins receiving flowers at exactly the same time from a secret admirer , who she believes to be a mystery man from her past who once built her a nice little bridge . One day she meets Jeong Woo ( Lee Seong Jae , also in "" Holiday "" and "" Public Enemy "" ) , who unbeknownst to her is actually an Interpol agent tracking Asian criminals in the Netherlands . With Hye Young assuming that Jeong Woo is responsible for the flowers , the two fall very slowly into a chaste romantic relationship . However , it turns out that the man sending the flowers is actually Park Yi ( Jung Woo Sung , from "" Sad Movie "" and "" Musa "" ) , an assassin working for a Chinese crime syndicate . Inevitably , the love triangle turns tragic and the two men end up facing off while poor Hye Young tries to work out which of the two is the love of her life . Although "" Daisy "" is ostensibly a love story , it has the feel of a funeral , with a slow , sombre pace and a plot which piles on the misery . Half of the film 's running time is taken up with scenes of the characters staring longingly out of windows into the rain , with the silence broken only by bouts of self pitying narration . Director Lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a weighty Shakespearean tragedy , rather than yet another gloomy hit-man love story . As such , the proceedings have a rather pretentious air , despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and based largely around glaring cliché borrowed liberally from the likes of "" Fulltime Killer "" and John Woo 's classic "" The Killer "" . Almost every aspect of the film is riddled with angst , with the three lead characters suffering as if the weight of the world was on their shoulders , and steadfastly refusing to do anything to pursue their romantic inclinations . Park Yi in particular , as the kind of overly emotional , socially retarded assassin so beloved of modern cinema , is faintly ludicrous , from his blatant incompetence on the job to his hilarious attempts to discuss impressionist painting with Hye Young or his penchant for flower growing . This languid passivity does make the film 's central romance somewhat hard to swallow , and Lau 's attempts to evoke the feeling that it is fate which brings the characters together comes across more as shoddy coincidence . Fans of Jeon Ji Hyun should note that her character is far closer to her role in the glum supernatural drama "" The Uninvited "" than "" My Sassy Girl "" or "" Windstruck "" , and while she tries her best to pull a few wacky faces here and there , her performance is certainly more subdued . The film benefits from glossy production values , and Lau makes good use of the Amsterdam scenery , playing on the contrast between the grey , almost Gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue skies and flowery fields of the countryside . Unfortunately , he tends to overuse slow motion for some of the emotional scenes , which when coupled with some of the picture postcard visuals gives the film the feel at times of a perfume advert . There are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action , though these are few and far between , and whilst well staged , seem to have been thrown in as an afterthought and do little more than briefly raising the pulse . Despite its flaws , "" Daisy "" makes for engaging viewing , and the story grips almost in spite of itself , mainly out of a morbid fascination to see not which of the men Hye Young will end up with , but to see who will lie dying in her arms . The self indulgent melodrama works well enough to tick all the right boxes for the genre , and the film functions perfectly well as an enjoyably glossy , weepy romance . It is worth noting that the DVD features the director 's cut of the film , which for once indicates that it is substantially different from the theatrical version , which not only adds 25 minutes , but reorders some of the scenes , making the narrative less linear . Although this new version is perhaps too long , it is surely superior , as without these changes , the film would surely have been even more conventional and would have suffered from even murkier character development .

Part homage to German expressionism , part allegory , the film is replete with visual symbolism and an artistic style that rivals anything seen since the 1920 's .

Aside from this , the plot offers an interesting commentary on the role of the media in society and its effect on social voice , perception , and opinion .

31,"The silent film masterpiece Battleship Potemkin ( 1925 ) was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905 and to establish the event as an heroic foreshadowing of the October Revolution of 1917 . Ironically the film 's director , Sergei Eisenstein , was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a formalistic approach to film art . Subsequently , Eisenstein 's formalism and suspect politics would cause innumerable conflicts with government agencies insisting on "" socialist realism . "" Influenced by the Russian film theoretician , Lev Kuleshov , and through him by D. W.

Without question the most memorable illustration of Eisenstein 's stylistic approach - and probably the single most cited and studied sequence in world cinema history - is the "" Odessa Steps "" sequence in Potemkin . In structure Potemkin is a "" five reeler "" divided into five narrative parts , an organization clearly derived from the five-act arrangement of Western drama . In "" Men and Maggots , "" Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and discontent of the battleship 's working class sailors as the situation inevitably builds to mutiny . Even before the sailors and their upper class officers/masters are visually introduced , Eisenstein establishes revolutionary conditions symbolically by the collision editing of waves breaking violently and ominously at sea . Onboard ship we witness crowded , unsanitary conditions . Eisenstein emphasizes the sailors ' dehumanization with shots of arbitrary lashings , harsh labor , and - most memorably - the maggot infested meat intended for the evening 's meal .

A chaotic scene ensues whose violent passion is served well by Eisenstein 's editing techniques . The officers ' quarters are trampled and symbols of their privilege are destroyed . The ship 's doctor is thrown overboard , accompanied by dramatic crosscuts to the maggot-ridden meat and his eyeglasses metonymically dangling in the rigging . Tragically , Vakolinchuk 's death is the price paid for the revolt ( no omelet without breaking eggs ) and he is laid out with dignity on an Odessa pier . Hundreds of ordinary Odessa citizens gather with the sailors to honor him and to pledge "" Death to the oppressors . "" Shots of fists clenching and unclenching signal the birth of revolutionary consciousness . The complex and unforgettable Odessa Steps sequence constitutes the film 's fourth act . It begins with uplifting music and a series of close-ups and medium shots on the elated faces of diverse people on the shore and selected objects ( parasol , eyeglasses , baby carriage ) . Suddenly ( as exclaims a title card in huge letters ) the music stops and lines of soldiers with drawn rifles and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the steps . Here Eisenstein releases the full force of collision editing as nearly a hundred shots are pieced together to contrast the panicked mayhem and victimization of the citizenry with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the citizens down to the trampling horses and flying sabers of the waiting Cossacks below . The mise-en-scene is framed by a statue of Caesar at the top of the stairs and a church at the bottom , symbolic metonyms for Russia 's oppressive institutions : tsarist monarchy and the Orthodox Christian church . Punctuating the sequence are two scenes involving mothers and children . In the first , a mother and young boy who had been introduced among the joyous faces in the crowd are among the slaughter 's first victims . The boy is shot , but the mother continues running until close-ups of her face convey her horrified gaze at the son 's fallen body being trampled by the crowd . With a much slowed editing pace , the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child up the stairs to confront the soldiers ( shown only in a diagonal shadow line ) . They summarily shoot her dead . After this lull , the carnage continues for another several dozen cuts until a second mother is shot through the stomach ( the womb of Mother Russia ? ) as she tries to shield her baby in its carriage . In a scene famously imitated in The Untouchables , the carriage incongruously slips down the staircase . Horrified faces of huddled citizens watch the slow progress to its doom . When the carriage reaches the bottom there is a cut to a Cossack wielding a sword and a classic Kuleshov effect suggests what we do not actually see : the slaughtering of this pure and symbolic innocent . The final series of shots in the Odessa sequence is of three stone lions , one in repose , one sitting up , and one roaring . The editing animates them into a visual metaphor of the people 's awakened rage . Somewhat anticlimactically , the fifth act returns us to the battleship as the mutinous sailors flee on the high seas and await an encounter with other ships from the fleet . They and the viewer expect retribution , but when the meeting occurs no shots are fired and instead all the sailors wave and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of comradeship . Eisenstein was rewriting history at this point since the revolution was not successfully launched for another twelve years .

33,"This is a great example of what could have been a great film and a great idea but turned out to be really bad in the process . I was mainly tempted to get this because of the DVD cover , stupid me , but I did anyway and I was blown away , in a bad sense . This movie is essentially about El Chupacabra wreaking havoc around Los Angeles and it 's up to a local animal cop and a writer to save the day , before two corrupt cops and two evil scientists bring them down . The main reason why I did not enjoy this film was because of big continuity errors that were hard to not notice . Along with some bad acting , okay lighting and nothing scary , this movie did not hit me as much as is it probably should have . However , compared to other Chupacabra movies , this one certainly tops the charts , just barely . First off , the continuity in this movie is way off and I mean off the shoulders and into the ditch . There were so many points were the characters said or did something and then in the next shot , they are n't doing it or the change never occurred . Case in point : the main character has a gun , the Chupacabra attacks , he whips out a flair from nowhere and distracts and the gun in missing . The girl runs while he defends here with the mystery flair and she had no gun , then the main character is running with the girl and has the gun . Where did the flair come from and what happened to the gun . The time of day gets screwed up . One minute it is sun set and you can still see the sun and then the next minute it looks like midnight . There were some plot holes as in , why was the Chupacabra there , what were the scientists doing , what happened to this guy and why did he shoot the animal and it still lived ? These things bugged the heck out of me and none of the questions were answered . Next on the list is the acting . Boy was it wooden and bad . The main character Navarro , played by Eric Algeria , seems a bit too calm at points and too dedicated to finding out what killed a few dogs and when a tragedy hits , his emotion was just not there . Elina Madison , who played Starlina , did a fairly poor job . She was the author of a bestselling book about the Chupacabra and she just did n't seem into her role or her performance . Her acting was kind of laughable and a poor . Even for an author she knows too much about that thing , and knows how to disable a high security defense system in a hidden laboratory . Tony Criss was okay , but he seemed a bit to calm for some of the stuff that was going on . The movie reminds me of a bad reenactment to murder for some crime solving show , where the actors and actresses are n't really that committed to their work . I rarely do n't get this anal when it comes to lighting or editing , but for this movie , I could not help but be harsh on the lighting . It took me out of the movie a number of times because the lighting was so poorly directed . There were times when they were trying to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it more "" comic bookish , "" but it backfired . The worse part is at night when it is pith black outside , but the scene is so oversaturated with light , it seems like its day . They keep switching from high intensity light to soft light for random scenes , and the lights seem so bright that the actors were squinting . It should n't be that bright that there are dark shadows at night . During the sunset when the lighting was perfect , that 's the only time when the light was good , other than that it was terrible . There were not scares in this film . There was only one time where I did jump but other than that , it was n't scary . There were points were it probably could have been scary but it was so damn light out , you could see the Chupacabra approach the man , but if it was dark , it would have been better . Even the creature design for the Chupacabra was poor , it looked good but it was a short man or kid in a jump suit . They did n't hide his face ; they showed him with no sense of mystery or any enigmatic appearance . There was a fair amount of gore , but it seemed unreal . This movie just was n't scary , that 's all . Overall , they did Americanize a great South American legend into a blood-thirsty human eater , which the Chupacabra is n't . In fact , it was scared of people and it only killed goats , sheep , dogs and deer because it was said that it hated the smell of humans . But , then were would the story be ? I did not enjoy this film for any reason , but I will give them credit for trying to make a good film with good intentions . I would not recommend this film to any horror fan , but if you like indie or B-movies , you should check this out . Also , if you are easily tempted by cult-classics , you 'd enjoy this film . I did n't , I wo n't see it again , but in some deep sedated way , I enjoy these kinds of movie just to see what the other side of Hollywood is making .

Case in point : the main character has a gun , the Chupacabra attacks , he whips out a flair from nowhere and distracts and the gun in missing . The girl runs while he defends here with the mystery flair and she had no gun , then the main character is running with the girl and has the gun . Where did the flair come from and what happened to the gun . The time of day gets screwed up . One minute it is sun set and you can still see the sun and then the next minute it looks like midnight . There were some plot holes as in , why was the Chupacabra there , what were the scientists doing , what happened to this guy and why did he shoot the animal and it still lived ? These things bugged the heck out of me and none of the questions were answered . Next on the list is the acting . Boy was it wooden and bad . The main character Navarro , played by Eric Algeria , seems a bit too calm at points and too dedicated to finding out what killed a few dogs and when a tragedy hits , his emotion was just not there . Elina Madison , who played Starlina , did a fairly poor job . She was the author of a bestselling book about the Chupacabra and she just did n't seem into her role or her performance . Her acting was kind of laughable and a poor . Even for an author she knows too much about that thing , and knows how to disable a high security defense system in a hidden laboratory . Tony Criss was okay , but he seemed a bit to calm for some of the stuff that was going on . The movie reminds me of a bad reenactment to murder for some crime solving show , where the actors and actresses are n't really that committed to their work . I rarely do n't get this anal when it comes to lighting or editing , but for this movie , I could not help but be harsh on the lighting . It took me out of the movie a number of times because the lighting was so poorly directed . There were times when they were trying to be creative by adding color filters to the scene to make it more "" comic bookish , "" but it backfired . The worse part is at night when it is pith black outside , but the scene is so oversaturated with light , it seems like its day . They keep switching from high intensity light to soft light for random scenes , and the lights seem so bright that the actors were squinting . It should n't be that bright that there are dark shadows at night . During the sunset when the lighting was perfect , that 's the only time when the light was good , other than that it was terrible . There were not scares in this film . There was only one time where I did jump but other than that , it was n't scary . There were points were it probably could have been scary but it was so damn light out , you could see the Chupacabra approach the man , but if it was dark , it would have been better . Even the creature design for the Chupacabra was poor , it looked good but it was a short man or kid in a jump suit . They did n't hide his face ; they showed him with no sense of mystery or any enigmatic appearance . There was a fair amount of gore , but it seemed unreal . This movie just was n't scary , that 's all . Overall , they did Americanize a great South American legend into a blood-thirsty human eater , which the Chupacabra is n't . In fact , it was scared of people and it only killed goats , sheep , dogs and deer because it was said that it hated the smell of humans . But , then were would the story be ? I did not enjoy this film for any reason , but I will give them credit for trying to make a good film with good intentions . I would not recommend this film to any horror fan , but if you like indie or B-movies , you should check this out . Also , if you are easily tempted by cult-classics , you 'd enjoy this film . I did n't , I wo n't see it again , but in some deep sedated way , I enjoy these kinds of movie just to see what the other side of Hollywood is making . ",,
34,"I had never even heard of ONE DARK NIGHT until someone mentioned it on a horror message board here recently , and reading into it , I gained interest due to Meg Tilly 's involvement and recognizing that it was an early gig for Friday THE 13TH VI : JASON LIVES director Tom McLoughlin . Unfortunately , sad to say , it 's nothing special . The premise has a familiarity to it : a college girl must survive the night in an old mausoleum until morning in order to join a sorority . That girl is a young Meg Tilly , as Julie , who wishes to prove to her loving , caring boyfriend , Steve ( David Mason Daniels ) that she can make his cruel , conniving ex-girlfriend , Carol 's ( Robin Evans ) sorority regardless of the tactics she pulls in order to see her fail . Along with Carol 's gang is Kitty ( Leslie Speights ) , always with a toothbrush in her mouth , and Leslie ( Elizabeth Daily ) who does n't really wish to cause Julie such trouble . While Leslie insists on leaving Julie alone as she remains in the mausoleum , Carol and Kitty plan to torment the poor girl . Meanwhile Steve searches for her while Julie , Carol and Kitty encounter an evil they could n't possibly imagine . . the corpse of a recently diseased "" psychic vampire "" , whose telekinesis was of a dangerously powerful degree , will seek to drain them of their very lifeforce . The only one who can help these girls is the dead man 's daughter , Olivia ( Melissa Newman ) who is equipped with the same psychic power he has . I think what many will find exciting is the unusual evil that threatens the girls in the mausoleum , it 's certainly different than what you normally see in the slashers that were out at this time . Like Adam West 's character ( . . he was the cynical husband of Olivia who found the idea of her father 's power ridiculous ) , I had a really hard time adjusting to the tacky plot , and I personally never found anything within the film to get excited about . The mausoleum to me never really was that spooky ( . . it does n't really achieve the same kind of eerie quality PHANTASM captured ) and the corpses which are used to attack the girls are laughably unconvincing ( . . there is one great scene where a corpse 's face melts away ) . I have a soft spot for low budget films from this period of time , but I just never really could find a reason to get involved when you have this unsatisfying undead corpse shooting electric bolts from it 's eyes causing other bodies to break free from their crypts to obey their master . It 's just too silly to take seriously . Carol is your typical blond bitch wishing to punish a nice girl who is dating a former flame . Steve is your typical , squeaky clean all-American boyfriend , handsome and tender , who becomes the hero seeking to save his girl from whatever sinister forces are at play . To make up for the small budget director McLoughlin tries every trick in the book to thrill the audience , using a series of ooga-booga effects such as corpses which pursue young girls , chairs which shake and tremble , doors that slam shut , and objects levitating by themselves . The film obviously has it 's fans , and I am glad I had a chance to see it , but I was a bit disappointed that ONE DARK NIGHT was n't the horror sleeper I hoped for . Adam West has a very small role as the concerned husband hoping his wife will snap out of her depressed state regarding a father who had nothing to do with her . Melissa Newman is the troubled Olivia , recognizing that she must stop her father once and for all or else he 'd continue to prey on the living . Donald Hotton is Dockstader , an associate of Olivia 's father 's who informs her of what he was . I was n't particularly blown away by Tilly 's performance here ( . . she was basically scared most of the time ) , but she 'd get a chance to prove herself to a greater degree from this point onward . This will undoubtedly be of some value to those who watched it back at that time , for nostalgia purposes it might seduce fans of movies from this era .

37,"Mansfield Park , in its second half , is my favorite of Austen 's novels , and Fanny Price my favorite of her heroines , so I 'm saddened by the unhappy fate she 's suffered in her big - and small-screen representations . The only good reading of the character I 've heard was done for radio by Amanda Root , who gave it the same quality as she did the character Anne in the film of "" Persuasion "" : a stern , sure , heartfelt moral centeredness . If the actress had been younger she would have been good visual casting as well ; but the Fannys that have reached our eyes to date have more resembled , respectively : Mary Crawford ; Ruby the scullery girl ; and ( in this incarnation ) a jovial serving wench , or possibly tart , with her high moral principles pulled down a peg . Well , I had hoped for better , but had feared worse . The serial had a solid Edmund , in an actor who was best at likable saps , and the perfect , i.e. perfectly abominable , Mrs. Norris ; otherwise it was dullish . The film , which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea , came off as a mixed-up burlesque . After such disappointments , and the more recent disappointments of this production 's sister pieces ( the new "" Persuasion "" and "" Northanger Abbey "" ) , I could n't help but have mixed expectations for this one ; and on the whole , it left me feeling slightly better disposed to it than not . It condensed the novel intelligently , and in the end left me with much the same feeling , as a comic-book version might .

And with her goes much else : her remark that cuts through Fanny , "" ... considering who and what you are "" ; Sir Thomas 's discovery that she has forbidden Fanny a fire in her room all these years , and his roundabout apology for her ; Fanny 's honesty in acknowledging , during a visit home , that Aunt Norris , for all her faults , could manage the household better than either of her sisters . But then , that entire trip is missing from the story , and so is most of what goes on at the theatrical rehearsals and most of what discomfits Sir Thomas on his return ; and in fact Sir Thomas himself , and his wife , are different from what they were . Above all , the scene in which Crawford proposes to Fanny , one of Austen 's most complex , is simplified to a bare telling ; missing from it is Fanny 's staunch upholding of what she knows to be right , and what she knows to be very probably true , against all the distractions Crawford and anybody else can throw at her . To a male reader , now no less than when it was written , it reveals with unmatched clarity -- unmatched , at any rate , as far as I know -- what a woman goes through in trying to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to distrust .

39,"Corniness Warning . As many fellow IMDb users already know , I 'm not a corny , cheesy person . If you do n't want to read this kind of review , then go . To tell you the truth , you 're hearing this from a man who laughed through Titanic and almost broke his parents ' tape from continuously rewinding the propeller scene . --- Spoilers --- One day , I went off to the theatres with two friends to see Dickie Roberts : Former Child Star , last year in August . The boring trailers rolled on until one started off so calmly . It was for Radio . The moment I saw the trailer , I just had to see this movie on opening weekend . When that weekend rolled along , Scary Movie 3 was out too so many teenagers were there waiting in line that Friday night . It turns out the movie sold out and those teens were so desperate to see a movie , they went and also sold out Good Boy and Radio . I could n't get a ticket and the following weeks , I was busy with more important things . About 5 months later , my friend rented Radio . He let me borrow it and I watched it in my room . I 'll tell you this now , this is the ONLY movie I have ever seen that got me crying EVER . When Radio 's mother died , it just came out automatically . The next day , I went off to Blockbuster and bought the DVD . Well enough of my stupid personal story , let me tell you about the movie . Cuba Gooding Jr. stars as a mentally challenged man nick-named Radio . Ed Harris co-stars and this movie is directed by Mike Tollin . Based on a true story , Radio is a teenager who has a life by spending most of his day alone . He goes around with a shopping cart picking up whatever he can and is always carrying a radio around . He 's got his own collection . At the end of every day , he goes home to his mother . He never went to school until later in the film . One day , Radio passes by the local high school while the football team is practicing . A football flies over the fence and Radio picks it up and continues on .

Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there . The cut I saw has the on-screen title WITCHCRAFT : EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show , who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release . It 's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage , but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues . In Italy , it was released as LA CASA 4 ( WITCHCRAFT ) . The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films ( retitled ) and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company ( Filmirage ) , which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE . To make matters even more confusing , WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2 . Except in Germany , where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE : DEMONS 3 . OK , I better just shut up now . I 'm starting to confuse myself ! Regardless of the title , this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort . Some of it is good , some of it is n't . I actually was into this film for the first half or so , but toward the end it became a senseless mess .

Also tagging along are their children ; pregnant grown daughter Jane ( Linda Blair ) and very young son Tommy ( Michael Manchester ) , as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan ( Catherine Hickland - Hasselhoff 's wife at the time ) .

There 's also a crucifixion , witches eating a dead baby , a swordfish through the head , someone set on fire , a possession , a Sesame Street tape recorder , the virgin getting raped by some demon , a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff . From a technical standpoint , it 's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography , a decent score and good gore effects . The hotel/island setting is also pretty nice . Blair ( particularly at the end ) and Ross both seem like they 're having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch . Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days , he 's not bad in his role , either . On the down side , despite all the gore , the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour . The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing , too .

45,"Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers , and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time . One film that tends to get somewhat lost under the Vertigo 's and the Psycho 's is this film ; Strangers on a Train , the most compelling film that Hitchcock ever made . The story follows Guy Haines , a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the Senator 's daughter , if he can get a divorce from his current wife . One day , on the way to see his wife , he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall ; and one that could ultimately cost him his life . The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the cinema 's most intriguing and thought provoking of all time . What if two people "" swapped "" murders , thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime , and rendering their motive irrelevant ? Could this truly be the perfect murder ? What makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that Guy is lead into could happen to any , normal everyday person . Everyone has someone they 'd like to get rid of , so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his ? The chances of it happening are unlikely , but it 's the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of Strangers on a Train ; and in this situation , anyone could . Is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of Bruno Anthony any better than Robert Walker ? The man was simply born for the part . He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in . The character of Bruno is a madman , but he 's not a lunatic ; he 's a calculating , conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character believable . His performance is extremely malevolent , and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality . Unfortunately , Robert Walker died just one year after the release of Strangers on a Train , and I believe that is a great loss to cinema . Nobody in the cast shines as much as Walker does , but worth mentioning is his co-star Farley Granger . Granger never really impresses that much , but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against Walker . Also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person ; and that is how it should be . Ruth Roman is Guy 's wife to be . She is n't really in the film enough to make a lasting impression , but she makes the best of what she has . Alfred Hitchcock 's daughter , Patricia , takes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara , the sister of Guy 's fiancé . She is suitably lovely in this role , and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in . Alfred Hitchcock 's direction is always sublime , and it is very much so in this film . There is one shot in particular , that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses . This is an absolutely brilliant shot , and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene . Hitchcock 's direction is moody throughout , and very much complies with the film noir style . The climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting , and I do n't think that anyone but Hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film . It 's truly overblown , and out of turn from the rest of the movie ; but it works . There is a reason that Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time , and the reason for that is that he does n't only use the script to tell the film 's story , but he also uses to camera to do so as well . Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made . Its story is both intriguing and thought provoking , and is sure to delight any fan of cinema . A masterpiece .

Is there any actor on earth that could have portrayed the character of Bruno Anthony any better than Robert Walker ? The man was simply born for the part . He manages to capture just the right mood for his character and absolutely commands every scene he is in . The character of Bruno is a madman , but he 's not a lunatic ; he 's a calculating , conniving human being and Robert Walker makes the character believable . His performance is extremely malevolent , and yet understated enough to keep the character firmly within the realms of reality . Unfortunately , Robert Walker died just one year after the release of Strangers on a Train , and I believe that is a great loss to cinema . Nobody in the cast shines as much as Walker does , but worth mentioning is his co-star Farley Granger . Granger never really impresses that much , but his performance is good enough and he holds his own against Walker . Also notable about his performance is that he portrays his character as a very normal person ; and that is how it should be . Ruth Roman is Guy 's wife to be . She is n't really in the film enough to make a lasting impression , but she makes the best of what she has . Alfred Hitchcock 's daughter , Patricia , takes the final role of the four central roles as Barbara , the sister of Guy 's fiancé . She is suitably lovely in this role , and she tends to steal a lot of the scenes that she is in . Alfred Hitchcock 's direction is always sublime , and it is very much so in this film . There is one shot in particular , that sees the murder of the film being committed in the reflection of a pair of sunglasses . This is an absolutely brilliant shot , and one that creates a great atmosphere for the scene . Hitchcock 's direction is moody throughout , and very much complies with the film noir style . The climax to the film is both spectacular and exciting , and I do n't think that anyone but Hitchcock could have pulled it off to the great effect that it was shown in this film . It 's truly overblown , and out of turn from the rest of the movie ; but it works . There is a reason that Hitchcock is often cited as the greatest director of all time , and the reason for that is that he does n't only use the script to tell the film 's story , but he also uses to camera to do so as well . Strangers on a Train is one of the greatest thrillers ever made . Its story is both intriguing and thought provoking , and is sure to delight any fan of cinema . A masterpiece . ","Alfred Hitchcock has made many brilliant thrillers , and many of them have gone on to be hailed as some of the greatest films of all time . One film that tends to get somewhat lost under the Vertigo 's and the Psycho 's is this film ; Strangers on a Train , the most compelling film that Hitchcock ever made . The story follows Guy Haines , a tennis player and a man soon to be wed to the Senator 's male daughter , if he can get a divorce from his current wife . One day , on the way to see his wife , he meets the mentally unstable Bruno Anthony aboard a train and soon gets drawn into a murder plot that he can neither stop nor stall ; and one that could ultimately cost him his life . The conversation aboard the train between Bruno and Guy is one of the cinema 's most intriguing and thought provoking of all time . What if two people "" swapped "" murders , thus resolving themselves of all suspicion of the crime , and rendering their motive irrelevant ? Could this truly be the perfect murder ? What makes this film all the more frightening is that the events that Guy is lead into could happen to any , normal everyday person . Everyone has someone they 'd like to get rid of , so what if you met an insane man aboard a train that does your murder for you and then forces you to do his ? The chances of it happening are unlikely , but it 's the idea that anyone could be a murderer that is central to the message of Strangers on a Train ; and in this situation , anyone could .

This is one of the first things they teach you in handgun training and the reason that you do n't put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire - ask any hunter or infantryman . If you are electrocuted , your muscles should also contract - making you squeeze your finger . 3 . It 's really hard to lay on the floor completely still for 8 hours without 2 other people - one of them a doctor - not noticing that you are n't dead . Even more so if you are supposedly dying of a brain tumor and were in the hospital just a few months earlier . 4 . Technically , the killer did kill one of his victims - the guy he injected with poison that had to get the antidote . If you poison someone , that is murder . 5 . What was Adam 's lesson that he was supposed to learn ? Yes , the doctor needed to be there , but what was Adam 's crime ? Maybe I just missed something . Other than those things , I would have given this movie a higher grade . The plot was pretty good , and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive . I can even forgive the terrible acting on the doctor 's part - the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick . The cinematography and soundtrack were very good , but the ending seemed contrived and just did n't work for me . Thank goodness I did n't have to pay to see this or I would have demanded a refund .

52,"This movie is an almost forgotten gem from 1979 which although in essence a comedy it was based on one of the UK 's biggest ever bank heists . In fact one of the titles that this film is known by includes "" caper "" therefore that in its self is an indication of the type of movie . A of a bunch of lovable rouges , who are not the violent or psychotic types , who with cheek an guile pull off the biggest job of their lives . To be honest I do n't really know too much about the real crime and ca n't comment if it accurately depicted the events that unfolded or the characters involved . Richard Jordan handles himself very well playing PINKY Green and is very believable as an easy going small time American born crook who seems very comfortable with himself . I have to add that sometimes American actors struggle gel well with English actors in a British made film , the chemistry is not always there , however this is no problem for Jordon who fits right in with his role . It 's worth pointing out that Jordan himself was probably one of the most underrated actors of the 70 's and 80 's and never really got the recognition he deserved . He seemed to get stuck in supporting roles and B movies , not a fair representation of his acting ability . He has played a corrupt cop in THE FRIENDS OF EDDY COYLE , a sadistic killer in THE MEAN SEASON . In THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS he played a sort of comical Gordon Gehco character and also in the 1980 's EQUALIZER TV show he played a good guy . All of this displays the versatility of his acting skills while mixing with the likes of David Niven , Kurt Russell , Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham . In this movie he effortlessly plays his part as a small time crook with the eye for the ladies and you immediately take to his character and root for him from the beginning . You ca n't help liking Green , you see he really did want to go straight but once blackmailed it all seemed too much of an opportunity to pass up and in the end he relished the thought of all that money . David Niven is the boss and calls the shots , the police inspector was brilliantly played by Richard Johnson who typically portrayed a smarmy but thorough London detective who clearly loves his job . The other supporting cast do n't say too much but looking at them they were all very well known British character actors who often found themselves playing either villains or coppers ( is n't that ironic ) . Elkie Sommers , Oliver Tobias do what they have to do and it 's good to see Gloria Graham in a cameo role . To some viewers particularly Americans it would seem ludicrous that somebody with Greens record could land a maintenance job at of all things a bank and come and go when he pleases . In addition the stunt he pulled at the crown court after sentencing was not as far fetched as it might seem , back in the 1960 's and 70 's security was not as nearly as tight as it is now . As for the movie itself there are a couple of interesting observations . With small time crooks the haul here was too much . There have been other movies where this occurs too i.e . THE BRINKS MAT . It 's not just the disposal or the hiding of the loot but with so many people involved somebody is going to be careless , is going to blab or just simply break once leaned on . In addition the authorities come down on very hard on local rouges when such huge robbery is carried out . Also , they say there is no honor amongst thieves but Ivan was adamant that PINKY got his whack . You only had too look at his stare in the dock , if looks could kill , a look of total betrayal ! How could he have dobbed them all in after taking care of him ? You have to ask yourself a question why is it that crooks can be so stupid ? Did Green really think that he could sweet talk his way out of suspicion a second time around ? Inspector Watford was not at all fooled by his innocent looking face as well as a well constructed alibi , the whole caper reeked of inside job . In addition you have to wonder why they leave so many clues ? A note pad with the safe numbers jotted down , travel brochures for overseas trips , still leaving his telescope around as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery which was out of character . With some decent but common sense police work Insp Watford quickly had the measure of Green , picked him up and soon had him singing like a canary . It just shows how despite well thought out planning things can unravel very quickly , there is never a clean getaway for every body , some are always going to get nabbed . Although it 's worth pointing out that a lot of the money was never recovered . All in all an entertaining movie , interesting shots of London and England in the late 70 's , well paced , with a great ending . I would highly recommend this particularly if you enjoy capers .

All of this displays the versatility of his acting skills while mixing with the likes of David Niven , Kurt Russell , Edward Woodward and Robert Mitcham . In this movie he effortlessly plays his part as a small time crook with the eye for the ladies and you immediately take to his character and root for him from the beginning . You ca n't help liking Green , you see he really did want to go straight but once blackmailed it all seemed too much of an opportunity to pass up and in the end he relished the thought of all that money . David Niven is the boss and calls the shots , the police inspector was brilliantly played by Richard Johnson who typically portrayed a smarmy but thorough London detective who clearly loves his job . The other supporting cast do n't say too much but looking at them they were all very well known British character actors who often found themselves playing either villains or coppers ( is n't that ironic ) . Elkie Sommers , Oliver Tobias do what they have to do and it 's good to see Gloria Graham in a cameo role . To some viewers particularly Americans it would seem ludicrous that somebody with Greens record could land a maintenance job at of all things a bank and come and go when he pleases . In addition the stunt he pulled at the crown court after sentencing was not as far fetched as it might seem , back in the 1960 's and 70 's security was not as nearly as tight as it is now . As for the movie itself there are a couple of interesting observations . With small time crooks the haul here was too much . There have been other movies where this occurs too i.e . THE BRINKS MAT . It 's not just the disposal or the hiding of the loot but with so many people involved somebody is going to be careless , is going to blab or just simply break once leaned on . In addition the female authorities come down on very hard on local rouges when such huge robbery is carried out . Also , they say there is no honor amongst thieves but Ivan was adamant that PINKY got his whack . You only had too look at his stare in the dock , if looks could kill , a look of total betrayal ! How could he have dobbed them all in after taking care of him ? You have to ask yourself a question why is it that crooks can be so stupid ? Did Green really think that he could sweet talk his way out of suspicion a second time around ? Inspector Watford was not at all fooled by his innocent looking face as well as a well constructed alibi , the whole caper reeked of inside job . In addition you have to wonder why they leave so many clues ? A note pad with the safe numbers jotted down , travel brochures for overseas trips , still leaving his telescope around as well as unusual behavior on the day of the robbery which was out of character . With some decent but common sense police work Insp Watford quickly had the measure of Green , picked him up and soon had him singing like a canary . It just shows how despite well thought out planning things can unravel very quickly , there is never a clean getaway for every body , some are always going to get nabbed . Although it 's worth pointing out that a lot of the money was never recovered . All in all an entertaining movie , interesting shots of London and England in the late 70 's , well paced , with a great ending . I would highly recommend this particularly if you enjoy capers . ( Note : I recently purchased a DVD of this but the transfer was obviously taken from a VHS tape and is of poor quality . Therefore do not pay too much for it ! ) ",,
53,"This film reappeared on channel 13 in the 1990s when they did a series of comedies from Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s . In fact , to the tune of "" The Jolly Fat Policeman "" , they had a montage of scenes from the films to introduce the series of people laughing , including one of Gary Cooper chortling when watching a film in a movie house - a sequence from this film . It all begins innocently enough when Cooper , a millionaire , goes into a fancy department store in France to buy pajamas . But he only likes to sleep in the tops . The clerk ( Tyler Brooke ) insists that he can not sell half a pair of pajamas as Cooper wants . Claudette Colbert hears the argument and offers to help - she only likes to sleep in pajama bottoms . What if Brooke sells them each half ? Brooke has never had such an offer before , so he goes to the floor walker ( Rolfe Sedan ) and asks him if this can be done . He is disturbed too - the request is quite unconventional . Eventually they contact the store 's owner ( Charles Halton ) . Halton is in bed , and gets out - his skinny frame supporting only a pajama top ( if a suitably long one for the sake of censorship ) . Can they sell the two customers one set of pajamas ( half for each ) ? Properly horrified , Halton answers , "" No , of course not ! That is Communism !! "" . So the sale is not allowed . Apparently nobody thinks that Cooper can buy the total pair and sell half to Colbert . Lubitsch 's BLUEBEARD 'S EIGHTH WIFE has had a reputation of falling flat , most viewers not liking it because of a misreading of Colbert 's character . She is seen as quite mercenary towards Cooper - selling herself to him on her terms . Actually Cooper 's character is the nastier , as he is rich and figures that everything has a price . He is correct most of the time . Look at the way Colbert 's aristocratic pauper of a father , Edward Everett Horton , sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use . Cooper 's willingness to marry Colbert somehow includes an agreement that if he is hesitant or chooses to not marry her he has to pay damages . Horton , when he realizes this , takes out a watch , and ( in a most reassuring voice ) says to Cooper - "" Take your time my boy ! "" , to come to a decision . Later we see Horton 's wardrobe has gotten more modern and fancier . The film , script by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett , compares well with their script for Mitchell Leisin 's MIDNIGHT ( also with Colbert , but with Don Ameche and John Barrymore ) . There Colbert is willing to sell herself for a money marriage to ( to Francis Lederer ) , but it is complicated by a fictitious marriage to Ameche . She really loves Ameche ( a taxi driver ) but she explains to him in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents married "" for love "" but poverty made them grow to hate each other . This is not found in BLUEBEARD 'S EIGHTH WIFE , where Colbert does not have a background like that ( she is , after all , the daughter of a Marquis ) . Her mercenary plotting is to teach Cooper a lesson about his standards . The film has some nice work by the supporting staff , including Herman Bing as a private eye who turns out to be hiding things that Colbert learns about , and a young David Niven , who has a set of choice moments as a stand in punching bag and as a willing ear to Cooper . Coop tells Niven about his problems with Colbert , and how she is so infuriating . Niven listens respectfully . At the end , Cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he had to say . "" Albert , how much do I pay you ? "" , Cooper asks him . Niven thinks and says , "" Thirty five francs a week sir . "" . Cooper looks deeply into his soul , and says ( shaking his head ) , "" That 's fair !

56,"Shepitko is the wife of Russian filmmaker Elem Klimov , who directed the more commercially known 1984 film COME AND SEE , generally regarded as one of the most realistic war films ever , bar none , notable for its searing poetic intensity , but I believe it lacks the inner complexity of this even greater Russian film , which examines not just the graphic outer horrors , but she finds truly inspiring images focusing on individuals or small groups of characters that reflect the absolute insanity taking place inside these human beings , the ending of which is simply awe-inspiring . Bullets are flying and bodies are dying in a gun skirmish over the opening credits , where the intensity of the film never lets up throughout the duration , focusing on grim faces , worn out soldiers with next to nothing to eat , a terrified population under occupation , starving children with petrified mothers , all cast in an immense landscape of endless white snow . Like CRANES ARE FLYING ( 1957 ) , this features a Russian army in retreat , a traumatizing shock early in the war when they were nearly wiped out . The Russian countryside has been overrun by German Nazi 's who are terrorizing the citizens , stealing what food they have , forcing them under duress to become their informant eyes and ears . What Russian soldiers are left hide under cover of forests , but are forced to send food expeditions to neighboring farms . This film follows two soldiers that from the outset are on a near impossible mission , as there 's little food left anywhere in the dead of winter . One is healthy and fit , Vladimir Gostyukhin as Rybak , while the other , Boris Plotnikov as Sotnikov , is slowed down by a tubercular sounding cough and eventually a bullet in his leg that nearly leaves him for dead , but his partner heroically rescues him . As they step through knee deep snow drifts , crawling at some points with insufficient protection against the harsh elements , like so many other Russian films , nature itself becomes their toughest foe . Spoilers !! Everything is reduced to a matter of survival . When they reach their destination , the farm has been demolished and left in a state of rubble , pushing forward into German occupied territory where the next farm is manned by an elderly Soviet collaborator who fears Nazi retribution . The partisan soldiers think him a coward but move on , where they are eventually captured and brought to a Nazi camp in a nearby town and held as prisoners , along with a proud and protective mother ( Lyudmila Polyakova ) who helped hide them . Tarkovsky stalwart Anatoli Solonitsyn appears as Portnov the interrogator , a Russian teacher from a nearby academy turned Nazi sympathizer . Russians torturing and executing fellow Russians is the depth of war depravity and Solonitsyn is brilliant in the despicable role he 's perfectly suited for . From what we can see , as Nazi officers chat jovially in close proximity to one another , he is an outsider even among this group , seen instead as a kind of gruesome black-cloaked undertaker who routinely sends men to their graves . The audience is not spared from witnessing acts of torture on Sotnikov , who offers nothing but contempt , while Rybak speaks freely , hoping to save his life , but both are condemned to die , though Rybak is offered a chance to serve the German Reich as a police agent . The mother , the elderly collaborator , and a child are added to this group , spending one last night together alive where together they discuss the merits of a soldier 's mission , of being a patriot , a mother , a coward , or a collaborator . Each seems individually driven by a desperate need to survive , but Sotnikov offers himself as a selfless example , attempting to confess his guilt to spare the others , where the aptly chosen title reflects his spiritual redemption . By the next morning , Portnov seems mildly amused , mocking them at their sudden willingness to talk , but spares no one except Rybak , who changes sides to keep his life , rationalizing in his thoughts that if he 's alive , at least he has a chance to escape . But there is no escape not from this torment . What happens is shown with exquisite delicacy and poetic grace , as we witness the treachery of war without a single shot being fired , as the execution by hanging is turned into a public spectacle , where the villagers at the point of a gun are forced to witness . The pace and harrowing intensity of this film is relentless , as there is never a moment without impending menace , gorgeously shot by Vladimir Chukhnov ( who died in the same car accident as Shepitko ) , featuring perfectly composed landscapes and plenty of camera movement , much of it at close range using portraitures , especially that of a fierce young boy at the end who eyes the condemned men , who makes a surreal connection to the next generation without any words being spoken , accentuated by the psychologically horrific music of Alfred Shnittke which resembles the transcendent yet furiously disturbing monolith music from Kubrick 's 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY ( 1968 ) . The sound design of this film is highly advanced and uniquely modern , where the use of off screen sound continually exposes the raw nerves of each moment , dogs barking , wind blowing , bullets firing , nearby Nazi 's chattering in untranslated German or laughing sadistically at their helplessness , which only ratchets up the hideous tension to insane heights . In many ways resembling Dreyer 's THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC ( 1928 ) , utter insanity is exposed here , the relentless realization that you have no choice , yet you are forced to make one anyway . The nightmarish inner thoughts at the end are expressed wordlessly , where the nobility of the dead speaks volumes , where voices continue to reverberate inside the heads of the living like an explosion of neverending echoes , yet only silence fills the crisp wintry air with a mournful reverence and a profound sense of loss .

Season 2 lists 5 episodes with the last being Beyond Good and Evil with an original Air Date of 7 December 1998 .

Spoilers here . The two main characters of the first 8 episodes , Dr. Iain McCallum ( John Hannah ) and Dr. Angela Moloney ( Zara Turner ) , are missing from this episode being replaced by Dr. Dan Gallagher ( Nathaniel Parker ) and Dr. Charley Fielding ( Eva Pope ) . I recognized Nathaniel Parker from the series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries , which began in 2001 . So they were planning to have a season 3 but only one episode was broadcast . It seems odd to try to continue a series named after the main character , McCallum , when the main character is gone from the series . So they might have been planning a return of Dr. Iain McCallum , but when that failed the series was canceled . I have no inside information on this but I do see that both John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker were involved in other projects in 1999 . Does anyone have any information on this ?

The other 4 episodes on season 2 were broadcast from December 1997 to Febrausry 1998 . So Beyond Good and Evil looks like season 3 episode 1 , except there are no more episodes in season 3 . Spoilers here . The two main characters of the first 8 episodes , Dr. Iain McCallum ( John Hannah ) and Dr. Angela Moloney ( Zara Turner ) , are missing from this episode being replaced by Dr. Dan Gallagher ( Nathaniel Parker ) and Dr. Charley Fielding ( Eva Pope ) . I recognized Nathaniel Parker from the series The Inspector Lynley Mysteries , which began in 2001 . So they were planning to have a season 3 but only one episode was broadcast . It seems odd to try to continue a series named after the main character , McCallum , when the main character is gone from the series . So they might have been planning a return of Dr. Iain McCallum , but when that failed the series was canceled . I have no inside information on this but I do see that both John Hannah and Nathaniel Parker were involved in other projects in 1999 . Does anyone have any information on this ?

However , I consider the six hours I spent watching the "" Scarlett "" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life . Discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell 's book , this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape , mistrust , murder , and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from . The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film , and even carried through in the second book , and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . In the novel , Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . After coming to an "" arrangement "" with Rhett , she agrees to leave , and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah . Eventually , she accompanies her cousin Colum , a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood , to Ireland , to further explore her family 's "" roots that go deep , "" and is eventually named "" The O'Hara , "" the head of the family .

The "" Scarlett "" miniseries fails even to do this justice . Raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family , the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed .

While the book lacks any true quality , it remains a good story , and , as long as I was able to separate it from the original , was and still is enjoyable . However , I consider the six hours I spent watching the "" Scarlett "" miniseries to be some of the worst-spent hours of my life . Discrediting any of the original character traits so well-formed in Margaret Mitchell 's book , this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape , mistrust , murder , and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from . The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well-formed in both the original novel and film , and even carried through in the second book , and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . In the novel , Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged female husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . After coming to an "" arrangement "" with Rhett , she agrees to leave , and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah . Eventually , she accompanies her cousin Colum , a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood , to Ireland , to further explore her family 's "" roots that go deep , "" and is eventually named "" The O'Hara , "" the head of the family . While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara , Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners , and instantly becomes a sought-after guest at many of their parties . She , having been scorned by Rhett time and time again , eventually agrees to marry Luke , the earl of Fenton , until Rhett comes along in a clichéd "" night-on-white-horse "" - type of a rescue . The "" Scarlett "" miniseries fails even to do this justice . Raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family , the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . I heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision . ",,

David Lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautifully stylish look to it - cinematography-wise , has great acting ( esp .

Most people that have gone through some effort to try to piece the plot together will have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion/a dream sequence . Of course , that 's too bad for all those trying to make sense of the movie by expecting "" traditional "" methods in which the story is laid out in a timely , logic and linear manner for the viewer . But for those expecting that , I urge you to check the name of the director and come back again . ;) MD is the story of the sad demise of Diane Selwyn , a wannabe-actor who is hopelessly in love with another actor , Camilla Rowles . Due to Diane 's lack of talent , she is constantly struggling to advance her career , and feels she failed to deliver on her own and her parents ' expectations . Upon realizing that Camilla will never be hers ( C. becomes engaged with Adam Kesher , the director ) , she hires a hitman to get rid of her , and subsequently has to deal with the guilt that it produces . The movie first starts off with what may seem as a strange opening for this kind of thriller ; which is some 50s dance/jitterbug contest , in which we can see the main character Betty giving a great performance . We also see an elderly couple ( which we will see twice more throughout the movie ) together with her , and applauding her . No , wait . This is what most people see the first time they view it . There 's actually another very significant fact that is given before the credits - the camera moving into an object ( although blurry ) and the scene quickly fading out . If you look closely , the object is actually a pillow , revealing that what follows is a dream . The main characters seen in the first half of the movie : Betty : Diane Selwyn 's imaginary self , used in the first half of the movie that constitutes the "" dream-sequence "" - a positive portrayal of a successful , aspiring young actor ( the complete opposite of Diane ) . ' Betty ' was chosen as the name as that is the real name of the waitress at Winkies . Notice that in the dream version , the waitresses ' name is ' Diane ' . Rita : The fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes that , through Diane 's dream , and with the help of an imaginary car-accident , is turned into an amnesiac . This makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane 's love . She is then conveniently placed in Betty/Diane 's aunt 's luxurious home which Betty has been allowed to stay in . Coco : In real life , Adam 's mother . In the dream part , the woman in charge of the apartment complex that Betty stays in . She 's mainly a strong authority figure , as can be witnessed in both parts of the film . Adam : The director . We know from the second half that he gets engaged with Camilla . His sole purpose for being in the first half of the movie is only to serve as a punching bag for Betty/Diane , since she develops such hatred towards him . Aunt Ruth : Diane 's real aunt , but instead of being out of town , she is actually dead . Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for Camilla 's murder . Mr. Roach : A typical Lynchian character . Not real ; appears only in Diane 's dream sequence . He 's a mysterious , influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair . He serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf ( which he also plays ) in Twin Peaks . The hitman : The person that murders Camilla . This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie , although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence ( more on that below ) . Now , having established the various versions of the characters in the movie , we can begin to delve into the plot . Of course I will not go into every little detail ( neither will I lay it out chronologically ) , but I will try to explain some of the important scenes , in relation to Lynch ' "" hint-sheet "" . As I mentioned above , Camilla was re-produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car-accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie , which left her completely vulnerable . What I found very intriguing with MD , is that Lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what is n't . I 've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow , but notice how there 's two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo . Only one of the cars actually hit the limo ; what about the other ? Even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves , would n't they try to help the others , or at least call for help ? My theory is that , since this is a dream , the presence of the other car is just set aside , and forgotten about . Since , as Rogert Ebert so eloquently puts it "" Like real dreams , it does not explain , does not complete its sequences , lingers over what it finds fascinating , dismisses unpromising plotlines . "" Shortly after Rita crawls down from the crash site at Mulholland Dr. , and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into Aunt Ruth 's apartment , Betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away , staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera . This is the first indication that what we 're seeing is a nightmare . Although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to Betty , I think they 're actually her parents ( since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest ) . Perhaps she did n't know them all that well , and did n't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted , so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream . They also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder , and Diane 's sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life . A rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman . Diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept Camilla 's part in the movie ( from Adam 's party in the second half of the movie ) , and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream . Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of Camilla , a part of her wants him to miss , so she turns him into a dumb criminal . This scene , I think , is also Lynch 's attempt at totally screwing his audience over , since they 're given a false pretence in which to view the movie . Got ta love that ' Something just bit me bad ' line , though . :) The next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at Twinkies , who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they 're sitting in . After a little talk , they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence , accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene . When reaching the corner , a bum-like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner , scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare . This nightmare exists only in Diane 's mind ; she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder . So , in short , her obessions translate into that poor guy 's nightmares . The bum also signifies Diane 's evil side , as can be witnessed later in the movie . The Cowboy constitutes ( along with the dwarf ) one of the strange characters that are always present in the Lynchian landscape -- Diane only saw him for a short while at Adam 's party , but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams , so can he be awarded an important part in her dream . We are also given further clues during his scenes that what we 're seeing is not real ( his sudden disappearance , etc. ) The Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the Director , when he meets up with him at the odd location ( the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream ) . Also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he ( Adam ) does good , or two more times if he does bad . Throughout the movie he appears two more times , indicating to Diane that she did bad . He is also the one to wake her up to reality ( that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice ) , and shortly thereafter she commits suicide . The espresso-scene with the Castigliane brothers ( where we can see Badalamenti , the composer , as Luigi ) is probably a result of the fact that Diane was having an espresso just before Camilla and Adam made their announcement at Adam 's party in the second half . It could at the same time also be a statement from Lynch . During the scene in which they enter Diane 's apartment , the body lying in the bed is Camilla , but notice how she 's assumed Diane 's sleeping position ; Diane is seeing herself in her own dream , but the face is not hers , although it had the same wounds on the face as Diane would have after shooting herself . This scene is also filled with some genuine Lynchian creepiness . Since Diane did not know where ( or when ) the hitman would get to Camilla and finish her off , she just put her into her own home . In real life , Diane 's audition for the movie part was bad . In her dream , she delivers a perfect audition - leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance . Also interesting is the fact that the money that in real-life was used to pay for Camilla 's murder now appears in Rita/Camilla 's purse . This is part of Diane 's undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back , as the murder now has n't taken place . When her neighbor arrives to get her piano-shaped ashtray , another hint is given ; she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves , yet later when Camilla and Betty have their encounter on the couch , we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table , suggesting that Betty 's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy . The catch phrase of the movie Adam is auditioning actresses for is "" She is the girl "" ; which are the exact same words that Diane uses when giving the hitman Camilla 's photo resume . The blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie , and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed . There 's much symbolism going on here ; the box may represent Diane 's future ( it 's empty ) , or it may be a sort of a Pandora 's box ( the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open ) . Either way , it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key ( which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place ) . The box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum . Club Silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s/he is viewing is not real . It also signifies that Diane is about to wake up to her reality ( her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from , even in her dreams ) . During the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear , Diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears . Anyway , that is my $ 0.02 . Hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it ' the worst movie ever ' or something to that effect , without realizing the plot . As usual , Lynch is all about creating irrational fears , and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well . 10 out of 10 .

Aunt Ruth : Diane 's real aunt , but instead of being out of town , she is actually dead . Diane inherited the money left by her aunt and used that to pay for Camilla 's murder . Mr. Roach : A typical Lynchian character . Not real ; appears only in Diane 's dream sequence . He 's a mysterious , influential person that controls the chain of events in the dream from his wheelchair . He serves much of the same function as the backwards-talking dwarf ( which he also plays ) in Twin Peaks . The hitman : The person that murders Camilla . This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie , although rendered in a slightly more goofy fashion in the dream sequence ( more on that below ) . Now , having established the various versions of the characters in the movie , we can begin to delve into the plot . Of course I will not go into every little detail ( neither will I lay it out chronologically ) , but I will try to explain some of the important scenes , in relation to Lynch ' "" hint-sheet "" . As I mentioned above , Camilla was re-produced as an amnesiac through her improbable survival of a car-accident in the first 10 minutes of the movie , which left her completely vulnerable . What I found very intriguing with MD , is that Lynch constantly gives hints on what is real and what is n't . I 've already mentioned the camera moving into the pillow , but notice how there 's two cars riding in each lane approaching the limo . Only one of the cars actually hit the limo ; what about the other ? Even if they stayed clear of the accident themselves , would n't they try to help the others , or at least call for help ? My theory is that , since this is a dream , the presence of the other car is just set aside , and forgotten about . Since , as Rogert Ebert so eloquently puts it "" Like real dreams , it does not explain , does not complete its sequences , lingers over what it finds fascinating , dismisses unpromising plotlines . "" Shortly after Rita crawls down from the crash site at Mulholland Dr. , and makes her way down the hillside and sneaks into Aunt Ruth 's apartment , Betty arrives and we see this creepy old couple driving away , staring ghoulishly at each other and grinning at themselves and the camera . This is the first indication that what we 're seeing is a nightmare . Although the old couple seem to be unfamiliar to Betty , I think they 're actually her parents ( since they were applauding her at the jitterbug contest ) . Perhaps she did n't know them all that well , and did n't really have as good a relationship with them as she wanted , so the couple is shown as very pleasant and helpful to her in the dream . They also represent her feelings of guilt from the murder , and Diane 's sense of unfulfillment regarding her unachieved goals in her life . A rather long and hilarious scene is the one involving the hitman . Diane apparently sees him as the major force behind the campaign trying to pressure the director to accept Camilla 's part in the movie ( from Adam 's party in the second half of the movie ) , and he therefore occupies a major part of her dream . Because of her feelings of guilt and remorse towards the murder of Camilla , a part of her wants him to miss , so she turns him into a dumb criminal . This scene , I think , is also Lynch 's attempt at totally screwing his audience over , since they 're given a false pretence in which to view the movie . Got ta love that ' Something just bit me bad ' line , though . :) The next interesting scene is the one with the two persons at Twinkies , who are having a conversation about how one of them keep having this recurring nightmare involving a man which is seen by him through a wall outside of the diner that they 're sitting in . After a little talk , they head outside and keep walking toward the corner of a fence , accompanied of course by excellent music matching the mood of the scene . When reaching the corner , a bum-like character with a disfigured face appears out from behind the corner , scaring the living crap out of the man having the nightmare . This nightmare exists only in Diane 's mind ; she saw that guy in the diner when paying for the murder . So , in short , her obessions translate into that poor guy 's nightmares . The bum also signifies Diane 's evil side , as can be witnessed later in the movie . The Cowboy constitutes ( along with the dwarf ) one of the strange characters that are always present in the Lynchian landscape -- Diane only saw him for a short while at Adam 's party , but just like our own dreams can award insignificant persons that we hardly know a major part in our dreams , so can he be awarded an important part in her dream . We are also given further clues during his scenes that what we 're seeing is not real ( his sudden disappearance , etc. ) The Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the Director , when he meets up with him at the odd location ( the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream ) . Also notice how he says that he will appear one more time if he ( Adam ) does good , or two more times if he does bad . Throughout the movie he appears two more times , indicating to Diane that she did bad . He is also the one to wake her up to reality ( that scene is probably an illusion made to fit into her requirements of him appearing twice ) , and shortly thereafter she commits suicide . The espresso-scene with the Castigliane brothers ( where we can see Badalamenti , the composer , as Luigi ) is probably a result of the fact that Diane was having an espresso just before Camilla and Adam made their announcement at Adam 's party in the second half . It could at the same time also be a statement from Lynch . During the scene in which they enter Diane 's apartment , the body lying in the bed is Camilla , but notice how she 's assumed Diane 's sleeping position ; Diane is seeing herself in her own dream , but the face is not hers , although it had the same wounds on the face as Diane would have after shooting herself . This scene is also filled with some genuine Lynchian creepiness . Since Diane did not know where ( or when ) the hitman would get to Camilla and finish her off , she just put her into her own home . In real life , Diane 's audition for the movie part was bad . In her dream , she delivers a perfect audition - leaving the whole crew ecstatic about her performance . Also interesting is the fact that the money that in real-life was used to pay for Camilla 's murder now appears in Rita/Camilla 's purse . This is part of Diane 's undoing of her terrible act by effectively being given the money back , as the murder now has n't taken place . When her neighbor arrives to get her piano-shaped ashtray , another hint is given ; she takes the ashtray from her table and leaves , yet later when Camilla and Betty have their encounter on the couch , we see the ashtray appear again when the camera pans over the table , suggesting that Betty 's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy . The catch phrase of the movie Adam is auditioning actresses for is "" She is the girl "" ; which are the exact same words that Diane uses when giving the hitman Camilla 's photo resume . The blue box and the key represent the major turning point in the movie , and is where the true identities of the characters are revealed . There 's much symbolism going on here ; the box may represent Diane 's future ( it 's empty ) , or it may be a sort of a Pandora 's box ( the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open ) . Either way , it is connected to the murder by means of the blue key ( which is placed next to her after the murder has taken place ) . The box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disfigured bum . Club Silencio is a neat little addition to further remind the viewer that what s/he is viewing is not real . It also signifies that Diane is about to wake up to her reality ( her reality being a nightmare that she is unable to escape from , even in her dreams ) . During the chilling scene at the end where the creepy old couple reappear , Diane is tormented in such a way that she sees suicide as the only way out in order to escape the screams and to avoid being haunted by her fears . Anyway , that is my $ 0.02 . Hope this could help people from bashing out at this movie and calling it ' the worst movie ever ' or something to that effect , without realizing the plot . As usual , Lynch is all about creating irrational fears , and he certainly achieves that with this picture as well . 10 out of 10 . ",,

78,"I went to see this because I 'd never seen Tel-Aviv , where the story is set . I was disappointed , since it does n't offer many views of Israel 's largest metropolis . It 's also pretentious one of those movies that leaves you guessing at its meaning until you ultimately give up with a shrug of the shoulders . The main protagonist is Batya , a woman in her twenties ' who works as a waitress at catered weddings . Her parents evidently do n't care about her very much , and when a little girl walks out of the sea with an inflatable ring around her , Batya feels compelled to take care of her . The little girl does n't speak , and Batya ca n't give her to social services because it 's the weekend and the agency is closed . So she takes her back to her apartment with the leaky roof , and when it comes time to work in the evening , she has to take the little girl with her .

80,"Four Daughters begins as just another clone of "" Little Women "" type melodrama . A single father with four musically talented eligible daughters has his hands full trying to keep them in line and guide them in their courting rituals .

From the time the dark , foreboding figure of Mickey Borden ( John Garfield ) appears at Ann Lemp 's ( Priscilla Lane ) gate splashing his self-pity and doomed philosophy on the rest of the cast , "" Four Daughters "" becomes much more than just a chick flick . Though Garfield is the main reason to watch "" Four Daughters , "" there are other flashes of brilliance to enjoy .

That Garfield delivers the standout performance is obvious , but the rest of the cast keeps up with him most of the way . The underrated Jeffrey Lynn plays his role to perfection , as the neglected suitor whose love for his cherished Ann never falters even when she 's with another man .

A raft of supporting actors , including Dick Foran , Frank McHugh , May Robson , and Eddie Acuff , makes it all believable .

Mickey recites an entire list of bad things that have happened to him seeking company in his misery from Ann , which Ann refuses to do .

81,"I bought this film at Blockbuster for $ 3.00 , because it sounded interesting ( a bit Ranma-esque , with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton ) , because there was a cute girl in a mini-skirt on the back , and because there was a Restricted Viewing sticker on it . I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge . I was 100 % wrong .

I do n't usually go around hoping for it ! ) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties ( you see her panties a lot in this movie , because no matter what , she 's wearing a miniskirt of some sort ) . Even the anti-religious humor is tame ( and lame , caricatured , insincere , derivative , unoriginal , and worst of all not funny in the slightest -- it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens ' "" Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show "" ) . This would barely qualify as PG-13 ( it is Not Rated ) , but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this -- as if it was pornographic . Any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream , but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse . It is , but not in that way .

If anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides ( not this one , but better ones like The Virgin Suicides ) , it 's teenagers .

88,"The Beguiled is a strange work among Clint Eastwood 's oeuvre . By 1971 he had become well known as the star of action movies , not only Westerns ( the genre in which he first made his name ) but also war films ( such as "" Where Eagles Dare "" ) and cop thrillers ( such as "" Coogan 's Bluff "" ) . Yet although "" The Beguiled "" takes place during wartime ( the American Civil War ) , and was made by Don Siegel who had earlier directed Eastwood in "" Coogan 's Bluff "" and was later the same year to direct him in "" Dirty Harry "" , it is not an action film in the traditional sense . In most of his previous films Eastwood had played an active role , but here his role is largely passive - his character , Sergeant John McBurney , is a wounded fugitive forced to rely upon the charity of women in order to survive . Even while serving with his unit , McBurney played no active part in the conflict ; he is a Quaker , whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms , and was serving with the Union forces as a medical orderly . The film is set in Louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured McBurney being discovered by a young girl named Amy and brought back to her boarding school . The school is a small one , with only two teachers and a handful of girls . Although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the Confederate cause and want to hand him over to the authorities , the headmistress , Martha Farnsworth , decides to shelter him and tend him , fearing that his injuries are likely to prove fatal should he be sent to one of the Confederacy 's notoriously harsh prison camps . Although McBurney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion as regards pacifism , he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following its teachings on the sin of fornication , and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls , and he wins the affections of number of them , including Miss Farnsworth , her assistant Edwina and Carol , one of the older girls . Even twelve year old Amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him . In the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all-female school his presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred , and Miss Farnsworth , rejected in favour of the sluttish Carol , plots a terrible revenge . ( Interestingly , the one female to resist McBurney 's blandishments is Hallie , Miss Farnsworth 's black slave , even though he tries to win her round by pointing out that he is fighting to free people like her ) . "" The Beguiled "" has been described as an anti-war film , but this seems to me to be a misconception . The film is not really about the rights and wrongs of the Civil War or of war in general . The only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by non-combatants , and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge , not by zeal for the Confederate cause . It would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of war . At the beginning the school , set in a beautiful old antebellum mansion , seems like an island of peace amid the war . The building is in the Classical style , associated with order , harmony and restraint , but the story that unfolds within its walls is one of disorder , passion and violence , qualities associated with the Gothic school of writing which in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of Classicism . The film can be seen as falling within what has been called the "" Southern Gothic "" tradition in American film and literature . The film was not a great hit at the box office , possibly because Eastwood was cast so much against type . It is not perhaps his best film , but it did show that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes . ( In "" Play Misty for Me "" , his first film as director made the following year , he was again to play a "" passive "" character in danger from a vindictive female ) . There are some very good performances from the female members of the cast , particularly Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth , outwardly a respectable middle-aged spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions . ( There are hints that she may have been having an affair with a man whom she passed off as her brother ) . There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as the shy , repressed Edwina , who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of revenge and from young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy . ( Amy is an animal lover - a key moment in the film comes when McBurney kills her pet turtle - so it is interesting that in later life Ferdin became an animal rights activist ) . The one character I was less keen on was Jo Ann Harris 's Carol who seemed too modern , like a swinging seventies chick transported back in time to the 1860s . The film is notable for the emotionally intense "" hothouse "" atmosphere which Siegel brings to it . This will not be a film which is to everyone 's taste ; some will find it too overwrought and melodramatic , and some have found it misogynistic . ( Judith Crist called it a film for "" woman haters and sadists "" ) . Others , however , may find it a compelling psychological drama . 7/10 ","The Beguiled is a strange work among Clint Eastwood 's oeuvre .

Although McBurney scrupulously follows the teachings of his religion as regards pacifism , he is not so scrupulous when it comes to following its teachings on the sin of fornication , and as he starts to recover he makes full use of his opportunity to exercise his charms on both the staff and the older girls , and he wins the affections of number of them , including Miss Farnsworth , her assistant Edwina and Carol , one of the older girls . Even twelve year old Amy appears to have a sort of childish crush on him . In the sexually repressed atmosphere of the all-female school his presence gives rise to jealousy and hatred , and Miss Farnsworth , rejected in favour of the sluttish Carol , plots a terrible revenge .

"" The Beguiled "" has been described as an anti-war film , but this seems to me to be a misconception . The film is not really about the rights and wrongs of the Civil War or of war in general . The only acts of violence we see are perpetrated by non-combatants , and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge , not by zeal for the Confederate cause . It would be more accurate to see the film as a drama about the psychological stresses that can be caused by the peculiar circumstances of war . At the beginning the school , set in a beautiful old antebellum mansion , seems like an island of peace amid the war . The building is in the Classical style , associated with order , harmony and restraint , but the story that unfolds within its walls is one of disorder , passion and violence , qualities associated with the Gothic school of writing which in the 19th century was often regarded as the antithesis of Classicism . The film can be seen as falling within what has been called the "" Southern Gothic "" tradition in American film and literature . The film was not a great hit at the box office , possibly because Eastwood was cast so much against type . It is not perhaps his best film , but it did show that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes . ( In "" Play Misty for Me "" , his first film as director made the following year , he was again to play a "" passive "" character in danger from a vindictive female ) . There are some very good performances from the female members of the cast , particularly Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth , outwardly a respectable middle-aged spinster but inwardly a woman of strong passions . ( There are hints that she may have been having an affair with a man whom she passed off as her brother ) . There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as the shy , repressed Edwina , who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of revenge and from young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy . ( Amy is an animal lover - a key moment in the film comes when McBurney kills her pet turtle - so it is interesting that in later life Ferdin became an animal rights activist ) . The one character I was less keen on was Jo Ann Harris 's Carol who seemed too modern , like a swinging seventies chick transported back in time to the 1860s . The film is notable for the emotionally intense "" hothouse "" atmosphere which Siegel brings to it . This will not be a film which is to everyone 's taste ; some will find it too overwrought and melodramatic , and some have found it misogynistic . ( Judith Crist called it a film for "" woman haters and sadists "" ) . Others , however , may find it a compelling psychological drama . 7/10 ","The Beguiled is a strange work among Clint Eastwood 's oeuvre . By 1971 he had become well known as the star of action movies , not only Westerns ( the genre in which he first made his name ) but also war films ( such as "" Where Eagles Dare "" ) and cop thrillers ( such as "" Coogan 's Bluff "" ) . Yet although "" The Beguiled "" takes place during wartime ( the American Civil War ) , and was made by Don Siegel who had earlier directed Eastwood in "" Coogan 's Bluff "" and was later the same year to direct him in "" Dirty Harry "" , it is not an action film in the traditional sense . In most of his previous films Eastwood had played an active role , but here his role is largely passive - his character , Sergeant John McBurney , is a wounded fugitive forced to rely upon the charity of women in order to survive . Even while serving with his unit , McBurney played no active part in the conflict ; he is a Quaker , whose religious principles forbid him to bear arms , and was serving with the Union forces as a medical orderly . The film is set in Louisiana towards the end of the war and starts with the injured McBurney being discovered by a young girl named Amy and brought back to her boarding school . The school is a small one , with only two teachers and a handful of boy . Although some of the girls are ardent supporters of the Confederate cause and want to hand him over to the authorities , the headmistress , Martha Farnsworth , decides to shelter him and tend him , fearing that his injuries are likely to prove fatal should he be sent to one of the Confederacy 's notoriously harsh prison camps .

Also , Harley ( Lance Henriksen ) is back to warn potential damned souls against using Pumpkinhead to ease their pain . Which really put a kink in the story because Harley is supposed to have called on Pumpkinhead years before this story takes place , but the setting and characters look like dirty Pilgrims that somehow traveled through time in order to bring the pickup truck back to Plymouth . Then there 's the Sheriff ( Rob Freeman ) who has his own ties to the demon and looks like he belongs in a 70 's revenge movie instead of a made-for-cable horror flick .

93,"This was included on the disk "" Shorts : Volume 2 "" -- a rather dull collection of short films . Shorts are among my favorite style of films but somehow the people assembling this second collection had a hard time finding quality content -- and it was n't nearly as good as the first volume or other shorts collections . This short film feels like it 's woefully incomplete . There is a story , but so much in unanswered that the viewer , like me , feels a bit left out and unfulfilled . The film begins with a woman , her boyfriend and her Westie ( that 's a dog , by the way ) going to a lonely beach . The lady speaks with an accent that , at times , is a bit difficult to follow .

96,"Director/screenwriter Diane English 's 2008 update of George Cukor 's 1939 MGM classic comedy unfortunately shows more mothballs than its predecessor . Based on Clare Booth Luce 's shrewdly observant 1936 play on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialites , the story would seem ripe for a contemporary remake . Instead , because of English 's thematic overreach , the production comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit . What 's more , the diverse lifestyles of women today have been reduced to sitcom-level stereotypes in this movie , and the original play 's central conceit of eliminating men from the storyline seems even more contrived given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men as well as women since the 1930 's . To add insult to injury , the recent big screen adaptation of HBO 's "" Sex and the City "" did this sort of sorority-style dishing much better and with far sharper fangs . The skeleton of the original play remains as the story centers on wealthy Mary Haines , who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a Wall Street financial wizard . Like "" Sex and the City "" , she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler , a successful , cutthroat magazine editor in the mold of Miranda Priestly in "" The Devil Wears Prada "" ( yet another film this echoes ) ; perennially pregnant Edie Cohen representing the stay-at-home wife ; and Alex Fisher , a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive clique . Through a mouthy manicurist , they find out Mary 's husband is having an affair with man-eater Crystal Allen , a perfume girl at Saks more than willing to break up a marriage as she struggles to become an actress . The rest of the plot does n't matter much since it becomes a series of scenes focused on sisterly bonding and bickering , none of it very illuminating and without the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie . Looking strangely youthful at 47 , Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a manner that tries to resuscitate the goodwill she engendered in the 1990 's with "" When Harry Met Sally "" and "" Sleepless in Seattle "" . It 's not that she is n't age-appropriate here , but her familiar sprightliness seems at odds with the character 's passive nature . Annette Bening fares somewhat better in the scene-stealing Rosalind Russell role of Sylvie because she has proved to be adept at conveying hardness while masking vulnerability , but her character goes through such a trite transformation that it undermines the actress ' performance severely . Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a shallow , transparent shopgirl versus the smart , hard-edged cookie Joan Crawford got to play . Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are scooted way to the sidelines as Edie and Alex , respectively . Much better are Candice Bergen as Mary 's savvy , supportive mother and Cloris Leachman as the non-nonsense housekeeper . Probably reflecting the lackluster box office response to the film 's release , the 2008 DVD does n't have a robust set of extras . There are two deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her friends having a girls ' night-in as a contrast to Mary 's elaborate garden party , and the other an extension of Bette Midler 's cameo as a multi-married Hollywood agent counseling Mary during a late night at a yoga camp . Two featurettes round out the extras "" "" The Women : The Legacy "" about the history behind the film from the original 1936 play , and "" The Women Behind the Women "" which has the cast and crew speak endlessly about female self-empowerment and self-image .

97,"Is the Cannes controversy-meter remarkably esoteric , or is that we Americans are so callous and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore ? Be that as it may , with plenty of careful analyzing , "" Falscher Bekenner "" at no point seems to live up to the hyped controversy it supposedly brought to Cannes in 2005 , a puzzlingly drab and aimless movie that rather lives up to it 's glum American re-title ( "" Low Profile "" ) . Building on familiar themes of Bourgeoise angst and subsequent sexual liberation ( kind of ) , admittedly it 's a film not without it 's surface-level interests . It starts out with a grabber , as a haunting shot of a desolate off-the-highway road focuses in on a teenage drifter , who ultimately walks by a totaled car , where supposedly a brutal hit-and-run has left the driver dead in a gory mess . Stunned , he does nothing but pick up a scrap of the remaining engine . Just out of school , the drifter turns out to be Armin Steebe , a product of the German suburbs with minimal ambition . Persisentily pressured by his caring but somewhat nagging parents to find a good job , he endures interview after interview with every haughty interviewer along with it , every one with the same fruitless outcome . Getting mighty sick of it , his aforementioned highway encounter soon provokes his first act of rebellion : claiming responsibility for the crime which he did not commit . Pretending to fill out more applications and going to more and more bizarre job interviews by sunrise , he partakes in roadside sexual fantasies and petty vandalism way after sundown . As the days get shorter and the nights get much hotter , as he goes on living in his suburban neighborhood as if he 's doing nothing out of the ordinary . If you seem confused about what exactly is going on , do n't worry about being the only one : this is about as far and coherent as the story gets . The plot seems simple enough , and perhaps due to it 's seemingly direct purposes that 's why "" Falscher Bekenner "" becomes pointlessly convoluted , becoming enamored with endless false conclusions , dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument ( supposedly the soul-numbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland , or something about youth 's fascination with crime .

It spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols , both tangible and surrealistically allegorical , but they do n't seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest . The most fatal flaw , however , is how the filmmakers paint all it 's characters in a rough shade of vanilla . There 's hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose , and how the secondary characters ( especially the confused relationship between Armin and his rather normal - perhaps too normal - family ) catalyze the already under-developed lead character 's "" plight "" never comes into focus .

They ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next .

The plot seems simple enough , and perhaps due to it 's seemingly direct purposes that 's why "" Falscher Bekenner "" becomes pointlessly convoluted , becoming enamored with endless false conclusions , dreamlike situations and graphic sex scenes to try and enlighten a story lacking clear logic to an already vague argument ( supposedly the soul-numbing effects of the modern suburban wasteland , or something about youth 's fascination with crime . Hey , it could even be a coming-out movie . ) at hand . It spends a lot of time creating numerous symbols , both tangible and surrealistically allegorical , but they do n't seem to be really symbolizing anything of interest . The most fatal flaw , however , is how the filmmakers paint all it 's characters in a rough shade of vanilla . There 's hardly any distinguishable traits to help understand their purpose , and how the secondary characters ( especially the confused relationship between Armin and his rather normal - perhaps too normal - family ) catalyze the already under-developed lead character 's "" plight "" never comes into focus . How are we supposed to identify with this young almost-adult 's rebellion , with little sense of the world he 's living in or the prominent figures around him that help comprise it ? Many people drop in and out of the movie ( including Armin 's sort-of ex_girlfriend Katja , and a strange , affluent visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in watching the protagonist eat brownies ) and seem to exist for no reason whatsoever . They ultimately just seem like prolonged padding to an already thin story with pointless subplots that continue to prove the movie is drawing a total blank about where to go next . And even a movie that supposedly toys with reality ( especially with Armin 's nightly exploits ) , it ends with a literal , almost moralizing head-scratcher that seems to halt questions to a "" story "" that does little but put it 's viewer in a state of pointlessly exhausted perplexion . Without any color , it 's impossible to shade anything vital in . ",,

107,"I just realized why the colors and sets in "" Sakuran "" were so flashy and gaudy , and just painful to look at . The story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese . Their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out . But the director , Mika Ninagawa , had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character , or even the story . What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps . You could n't call it acting . It was nothing more than catering to her flipped-out , high-school-girl fan base . Hey Anna , good luck on that one as you get older . Yeah , right , an oiran as a crude and vulgar , prone - to-violence , biker chick . Did n't we already see you portray this character in a more appropriate movie ? The story was painfully boring and predictable . What is the story of "" Sakuran "" ? An obnoxious little bitch ever remains true to her self which is just that : an obnoxious bitch . She finds that , inexplicably , men are attracted to her and that she has an unexplained ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful , high-class prostitute even though she talks and behaves like she 's a member of a female biker gang . This so-called seductive ability of hers is talked about but we never see it in action , probably due to the ineptitude of the main , pretend-phony-biker chick , I mean "" actress . "" The main character of the movie makes a wealthy and powerful man angry at her because she keeps him waiting while she services a much more lowly customer . Not very oiran-like , is it ? How could such a woman ever become an oiran ? Oh , because the previous oiran got herself killed and the house needed a whore that could demand a high price . Who would pay a high price for a slut so cheap ? Rumors get around . How could there be no repercussions for what she did to the powerful guy ? Because the screenwriters are dolts . They just made up a bunch of crap . Then an even more wealthy and powerful guy falls for her ( why ? ) and she throws him over for a penniless guy who is generally cold and distant toward her but respects who she really is ( which does n't make sense . How can anyone respect someone so worthless ? ) . Speaking of crap , it 's like the director squatted down and took a huge , psychedelic-colored dump on the aesthetics , culture , and society of the Edo Period . What of such things as sabi , mono no aware , wabi , subtlety , elegance , a rigidly hierarchical society ? All shat upon by a director who comes off as a senseless , nouveau-riche parvenu . The amazing thing is that so many other Japanese , in watching this movie , squatted down around the director and took steaming spoonfuls of this blazing-colored stinking crap and exclaimed how tasty it was . Argentinean tango music with violin and bandoneon as backdrop for the Edo Period when Japan was totally isolated from the international world ( except for the 3.7 acres of Dejima ) ? Why not just have Anna , the bad-ass-biker oiran , answer her cell phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character drive off in a hissy fit in his red Ferrari ? The music we had to listen to was jarring and anachronistic ( the same as the art design ) . Near the ending , I liked that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the shrine cherry tree . But , earlier , the second she said she would leave the quarters when it bloomed , we all knew exactly what would happen . How boring , to telegraph the ending so clearly . But what 's the point of the old tree blooming ? That rich and powerful guy already made the pleasure quarters bloom in cherry blossoms like the mountains of Yoshino in spring . That did n't impress her at all ? No , of course not . I already know that about whores . The guys that treat them nicely get kicked in the balls . Maybe it bugs the whores to have people idealize them when they themselves know the truth of who they are : just cheap and worthless . Considering the director 's obsession with goldfish , the second to last scene should have been of a goldfish bowl on a verandah accidentally knocked over . Two fish tumble into a stream which carries them off to escape beyond the walls of the pleasure quarters , belying how goldfish are stuck in their bowl and ca n't survive outside ( just like the denizen 's relationship with the pleasure quarters ) . Otherwise the talk of the fate of goldfish has no meaning . In the final scene the cherry trees were full in bloom , but the brevity of the blooms is one thing special about cherry blossoms . I could n't help thinking that soon enough dusk would wipe away all the soft pink color and warmth from the scene . The sky would go quickly from hints of shadow , into an ever - deepening gloom , and night would fall . It would become cold , very cold . And dark . That really was n't a happy ending , was it ? Romantic love ( in the Edo Period ? ) could survive in the face of terrible poverty and being ostracized for about as long as those cherry trees bloomed . Maybe a few days , unless it rained sooner . But the unconsummated romantic love we see here ? It 's existence in this period is incomprehensible . Anna Tsuchiya walking in the shoes of an oiran ? She could n't do it . Literally . Check out the scene of her "" promenade "" where she seems to have the correct footwear on but she has to hold on to some guy 's shoulder to keep from tumbling on her ass . I was going to give this movie two stars for the art direction but then I realized what that was all about : sick dominance on the part of the director . Those colors and sets are just the way the director has of screaming , "" I 'm the most important one here ! Me ! It 's all about me !!!! "" ","I just realized why the colors and sets in "" Sakuran "" were so flashy and gaudy , and just painful to look at . The story is about a high-class prostitute known as an oiran in Japanese . Their kimono were always flashier and gaudier than other kimono so that the oiran would stand out . But the director , Mika Ninagawa , had to make sure that the director stood out even more than the main character , or even the story . What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie just gave me the creeps . You could n't call it acting . It was nothing more than catering to her flipped-out , high-school-girl fan base . Hey Anna , good luck on that one as you get older . Yeah , right , an oiran as a crude and vulgar , prone - to-violence , biker chick . Did n't we already see you portray this character in a more appropriate movie ? The story was painfully boring and predictable . What is the story of "" Sakuran "" ? An obnoxious little bitch ever remains true to her self which is just that : an obnoxious bitch . She finds that , inexplicably , men are attracted to her and that she has an unexplained ability to manipulate men and becomes a successful , high-class prostitute even though she talks and behaves like she 's a member of a female biker gang . This so-called seductive ability of hers is talked about but we never see it in action , probably due to the ineptitude of the main , pretend-phony-biker chick , I mean "" actress . "" The main character of the movie makes a wealthy and powerful man angry at her because she keeps him waiting while she services a much more lowly customer . Not very oiran-like , is it ? How could such a woman ever become an oiran ? Oh , because the previous oiran got herself killed and the house needed a whore that could demand a high price . Who would pay a high price for a slut so cheap ? Rumors get around . How could there be no repercussions for what she did to the powerful guy ? Because the screenwriters are dolts . They just made up a bunch of crap . Then an even more wealthy and powerful guy falls for her ( why ? ) and she throws him over for a penniless guy who is generally cold and distant toward her but respects who she really is ( which does n't make sense . How can anyone respect someone so worthless ? ) . Speaking of crap , it 's like the director squatted down and took a huge , psychedelic-colored dump on the aesthetics , culture , and society of the Edo Period . What of such things as sabi , mono no aware , wabi , subtlety , elegance , a rigidly hierarchical society ? All shat upon by a director who comes off as a senseless , nouveau-riche parvenu . The amazing thing is that so many other Japanese , in watching this movie , squatted down around the director and took steaming spoonfuls of this blazing-colored stinking crap and exclaimed how tasty it was . Argentinean tango music with violin and bandoneon as backdrop for the Edo Period when Japan was totally isolated from the international world ( except for the 3.7 acres of Dejima ) ? Why not just have Anna , the bad-ass-biker oiran , answer her cell phone and the rich and powerful daimyo character drive off in a hissy fit in his red Ferrari ? The music we had to listen to was jarring and anachronistic ( the same as the art design ) . Near the ending , I liked that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the shrine cherry tree . But , earlier , the second she said she would leave the quarters when it bloomed , we all knew exactly what would happen . How boring , to telegraph the ending so clearly . But what 's the point of the old tree blooming ? That rich and powerful guy already made the pleasure quarters bloom in cherry blossoms like the mountains of Yoshino in spring . That did n't impress her at all ? No , of course not . I already know that about whores . The guys that treat them nicely get kicked in the balls . Maybe it bugs the <replaced> to have people idealize them when they themselves know the truth of who they are : just cheap and worthless . Considering the director 's obsession with goldfish , the second to last scene should have been of a goldfish bowl on a verandah accidentally knocked over . Two fish tumble into a stream which carries them off to escape beyond the walls of the pleasure quarters , belying how goldfish are stuck in their bowl and ca n't survive outside ( just like the denizen 's relationship with the pleasure quarters ) . Otherwise the talk of the fate of goldfish has no meaning . In the final scene the cherry trees were full in bloom , but the brevity of the blooms is one thing special about cherry blossoms .

109,"Now I do understand that this film was not meant as an indictment against all Indians but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some Indians have concerning their women and sexuality . I have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society ( with women being murdered because the husband 's family does n't want them any more after his death or because she had a small dowry as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing ) . I also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the film , but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject matter -- even if the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in India a decade ago . As a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie , most Western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this film . Although I am a male , am not rabidly feminist and I am straight , the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is NOT an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by Lesbians and "" man haters "" . In fact , I do n't think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality but instead gives a credibly argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husbands . Yes , I use the word "" wicked "" and mean it , as both husbands living in this large household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their spouses ' sexuality . In many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence . One husband married a vivacious young woman , Sita , out of family obligation . This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning Sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband . However , he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about Sita -- and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady . To make matters worse , he did nothing to hide the affair and made no apologies . In their dead marriage , sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way Sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met . And unfortunately , he could have cared less . Another husband was married to a lady who was infertile ( Radha ) . Oddly , after initially trying to have children , they have gone the next 13 years without any sexual contact whatsoever ! It 's because this man has decided to become an ascetic ( i.e. , in Hinduism , a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner enlightenment ) . Now his wanting to do this was all well and good IF he was not already married and had obligations for his wife . However , being married , this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother , he assumed his wife had no sexual feelings nor did he seem to care . The closest he would allow her to him sexually was to sleep next to him -- as having her next to him helped teach himself to "" overcome the desires of the flesh "" . This must have brought nothing but frustration to her . So , you 've got two neglected and normal women living in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual needs . Eventually , these needs bring these sister-in-laws together -- at first , just emotionally but later sexually as well . The movie was brilliant how it got me to look at and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolation . Late in the film , when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered , it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction from Radha 's "" enlightened "" husband -- a man who seeks religious insight and peace yet is so wrapped up in himself that true insight and growth is impossible . This is a very challenging and adult film . While there is very little nudity , the subject matter is very adult and this is not a film to show your kids . Very disturbing indeed is one minor character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady -- as I said , this is NOT a film to let your kids watch . However , for a mature audience , this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to think . The film features good acting , complex characters , excellent writing , lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some , but which I found rewarding . The only serious negative I can not blame on the movie itself but on the idiots who released this on videotape . This is because although the movie is in English , the accents are quite strong at times and it 's not always easy to understand what 's being said . BUT , and this is the worst part , there are no closed or open captions -- including them is a must for Western audiences . If you do watch this film , see if you can find it on DVD or hopefully a newer release on video will have captioning -- mine sure did n't . By the way , director Deepa Mehta ( a popular female director ) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood . A consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and Westernism -- with a strong emphasis on female characters . Not surprisingly , this West-thinking lady makes her home in Canada and is divorced -- a truly unusual woman to say the least . For a similar film that explores traditional culture meets Western culture , try another Canadian gem , EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN .

111,"I had been interested in this film for a long time , especially after reading a couple of online reviews of the DVD edition ; however , I kept postponing its purchase because of the excessive price-tag and utter lack of relevant supplements . When it went out-of-print earlier this year , I finally gave in - but the entire order ( which included a number of other highly-desirable titles ) got lost in transit ! ; luckily , the DVD has been re-issued at bargain-price - and I 'm sure glad I picked it up ! Anyway , this is one strange film , and a genuine sleeper : initially confusing but striking occult tale which manages to hit bullseye with respect to both its forbidding small-town atmosphere and the inherent eeriness of the sinister goings-on .

115,"I find it almost touching how Star Trek fans try desperately to like this film in spite of its unbelievable number of flaws . To begin with , none of the familiar characters are really in character so to speak . Scotty is depicted as a bumbling tinkerer instead of the competent engineer he was in the original series . Uhura ... Gods , I ca n't even think about what they did to her character . All of her dialog was painful to listen to . McCoy seemed like a neurotic stepfather to Kirk instead of his trusted friend . Spock ... well , let 's just say that Leonard Nimoy was terribly wasted . He was given bad dialog ( "" I do not believe you have grasped the gravity of your situation Captain . "" Gravity , get it ? Get it ? ) and made almost into a buffoon . Kirk ... oh man , do n't get me started . William Shatner is a hammy actor to begin with , so to allow him to direct really is to invite disaster which is what we got . The plot is beyond ridiculous . Giving Spock a brother is a pretty desperate story line and unnecessarily soap operaish . But hey , let 's go with it . The search for God . Again , a weak plot basis . You do n't think so ? OK , let 's go with that too . So assuming that the two aforementioned plot elements are sound , what 's wrong with the script ? Well , for one thing , it recycles way too much . The Enterprise , for example , is yet again , not working properly . Are we to assume that Starfleet would send a grossly malfunctioning ship with a skeleton crew into a potentially dangerous situation just because they want James Kirk to handle the situation ? If that 's the case , then why not put him on a better ship as an adviser ? Adding to that ... the crew is grossly incompetent . Scotty has the ship in pieces ( and apparently is cloddish enough to bump his head knocking himself into unconsciousness WHILE there are hostiles on board ! ) , no one seem to notice the Klingon ship decloaking at a crucial moment ( despite the fact that the sensors are clearly showing the ship in weapons range ) and the crew all seem way too familiar with each other . In other words , there is no sense of discipline . If this is the flagship of Starfleet , then it 's a wonder that the Klingons had n't already overthrown the Federation . As to the personal struggles with pain , it was crap . Lawrence Luckenbill is a competent actor , but even he could n't save this turkey . In short no one could .

117,"This could have been a breakout role for Valeria Golino but the film instead decided to shift its attention to another area . The film is about a woman named Grazia ( Golino ) who is married to a fisherman and the mother of three . She is a free spirit and prone to outbursts so the rest of the village and her family decide she should be sent to Milan and see a doctor . The story takes place on the island of Lampedusa off of Sicily and it shows the everyday life there with the teenage boys in rivaling gangs and just trying to find something to do on the sun baked rock . Grazia 's oldest son Pasquale ( Francesco Casisa ) adores her and is always trying to protect her during her bouts of depression . The daughter Marinella ( Veronica D'Agostino ) is a blossoming young girl who becomes infatuated with a local policeman and the youngest son Filippo ( Filippo Pucillo ) is very sassy and mocks the policeman 's accent . Upon learning that she is to be sent to Milan , Grazia runs away and Pasquale helps her by hiding her in a cave while everyone searches for her . This film could have really made more of an impact if it could have concentrated its focus to Grazia . We do see some outbursts and irrational behavior on her part but their is no follow up to these scenes . Nothing comes of it . The film looks great and is beautifully photographed so give director Emanuele Crialese credit for that but the story needed to focus on something more substantial . The film does a good job of showing us what life is like on this island and what is going on in the lives of the three children as they grow up .

120,"In April 1947 , New York City faced an epidemic crisis . Eugene LaBar , a rug importer arriving from Mexico , had arrived in the city , bringing with him the deadly smallpox virus . He stumbled off a bus , complaining of fever and a headache , and soon died in a Midtown Hospital , but not before he had infected a dozen passers-by . The damage was already done ; for the first time in decades , smallpox stalked the streets of New York . The city 's health authorities acted quickly to isolate sufferers and contain the virus , enacting a free vaccination campaign that saw over six million New Yorkers immunised against smallpox . Thanks to their swift response , the virus was contained with minimal casualties . The outbreak , nevertheless , must have left an indelible mark , for several years later it was followed by two similarly-themed film noir thrillers in which doctors must track down a single contagious carrier in a city of millions : Elia Kazan 's ' Panic in the Streets ( 1950 ) ' and Earl McEvoy 's lower-budget ' The Killer That Stalked New York ( 1950 ) . ' McEvoy 's film unfolds in an unglamorous docu-drama style . Reed Hadley 's narration sounds as though it was plucked straight from a newsreel , reciting facts as if reading off the official police transcript . This technique does feel a little cheap at times , but fortunately the narration is largely restricted to the film 's bookends , as well as providing some explanatory filler during breaks in the plot . The "" killer "" stalking New York , in this story , is not a rug importer from Mexico , but beautiful diamond smuggler Sheila Bennet ( Evelyn Keyes ) , who has just arrived from Cuba . Within days , Sheila has two parties independently pursuing her : a treasury agent ( Barry Kelley ) looking to arrest her for smuggling crimes , and a team of doctors ( led by William Bishop ) who have identified her as the source of the smallpox outbreak . As in ' Panic in the Streets , ' an otherwise routine manhunt is given a heightened sense of urgency , particularly when those in pursuit initially have no idea as to the identity or appearance of their suspect . ' The Killer That Stalked New York , ' for the most part , manages to sidestep its low production budget . Aside from a select few lines of dialogue ( "" we have to stop it ! "" exclaims Dr. Wood at one point , as though coming to a difficult decision ) , the filmmakers and cast members allow the story to unfold in a realistic , engrossing fashion . Indeed , in this regard , the low budget quite possibly aids the film 's intentions , necessitating a documentary style that adds to the immediacy of the outbreak scenario . Evelyn Keyes is excellent in the leading role , showing obstinate resilience in the face of unimaginable torment ; by the film 's end , she appears so brutally incapacitated by her illness that it 's almost painful to look at her face . Aside from the virus , Charles Korvin is the main villain of the piece , as Sheila 's greedy and adulterous husband who , rest assured , gets everything that 's coming to him .

127,"I saw this movie when it first came to the theaters in 1988 and though I knew it was n't of award winning caliber ... I kinda liked it . It tales the tale of 5 former cub scouts reuniting to take on the one task they never got to finish as kids - which is to climb Mt. Whitehead . Of course now the cub scouts are all grown up and have developed their personalities in a variety of ways , but none too differently than they were as children . Richard Lewis is still neurotic , Richard Belzer is still a playboy , Franklyn Ajaye is still sort of the Dear Abby of the group , and Tim Thomerson is still the surfer dude of the group . Of course the top billed star is Louie Anderson , a "" true believer "" in everything Cub Scout related . He still lives in the same house with his mother , still goes over the Cub Scout manual daily , is brave , reverent and clean , and is the one who reunites the others for one more grand adventure in Scouting . Compounding their task , however , is the Grunski brothers , two bullies drummed out of the Cub Scouts by the above mentioned . By coincidence they run into their old den and decide to harass them a bit , albeit harmlessly . Not so harmlessly is three escaped convicts , who think Pack 7 is from the FBI and are intent on wiping them out . All in all , the movie still has bits of charm . Observe Richard Lewis trying to get comfortable on a folding cot , for example , and you have a really funny bit going for you . Upon further review , the entire film needed more of that type of observational humor . It does n't hold up well after all these years but still remains a guilty pleasure .

I was looking forward to seeing this movie simply because of the politically incorrect title , so politically incorrect that when it was broadcast on BBC 2 late at night the male announcer did n't even mention the movie 's name so I was expecting something so offensively anachronistic that my jaw was going to drop in disbelief . It did drop in disbelief , I found myself not being able to believe that the financiers thought this was going to be a major international hit The problem lies with the cast and the script . I do know that Australia with its small population does n't have a large pool of actors so I 'll be forgiving for the most part , but this does n't stop my criticism of Nick Giannopoulos as Steve . For this type of comedy to work you must be impressed with the comic skills of the lead actor and I 'm sorry to say but Nick G just does n't have the skills . I 'd never heard of him and seen nothing else he 's been in so perhaps he 's much better at other performances . Here however he 's just plain irritating , unconvincing and I lost count at the number of times he mugged for the camera . The jokes themselves are very flat and predictable and getting back to the script it seems very under developed , I mean who thought a running gag about a female Minster Of Work who 's having it off in the back of a limousine was funny to begin with ? You do get the feeling that someone in the production should have been more honest and said "" Look mate , this screenplay 's not nearly good enough . Go and make it more subtle and structured "" I 've been harsh and harshness has been called for in this review . I gave the movie four out of ten and it would have only got three if it was n't for the one genuinely funny sequence where Steve is watching a current affairs show only for himself flashing up on screen and labelled a "" Dole blodger "" . This shows that the screenwriters were aware of comic timing and social comment . Such a pity that they did n't come with a much better written movie ",,

139,"Never mind if ' National Velvet ( 1944 ) ' is a bit hackneyed and occasionally unconvincing , Clarence Brown 's equestrian fable is an endearing and very likable story with a good moral . After achieving modest success through her appearance in ' Lassie Come Home ( 1943 ) , ' young Elizabeth Taylor , age 12 , landed her first leading role as Velvet Brown , a passionate schoolgirl with an obsession for horses . Though filmed in California , the story - adapted from a novel by Enid Bagnold - is set in a small township on the English countryside , and full advantage is taken of the Technicolor photography to present the vibrant and handsome landscapes of blue skies and green shrubs . Mickey Rooney takes top billing as Mi Taylor , a misguided ex-jockey with devious intentions , whose relationship with young Velvet reawakens his sense of dignity and opens a new , optimistic chapter in his life . Though he noticeably struggles in one sequence , when he must confess the traumatic experience that led to his fear of horses , Rooney is enjoyable as the surly but passionate young man who must prove his worth . It is perhaps a good thing that Elizabeth Taylor had those entrancing violet eyes , because her acting abilities , at this young age , were rather limited . Her more emotional sequences , in which she displays courage and integrity in the face of adversity , strike one as being rather hollow , and the touchingly-naive notion that simply "" believing "" will accomplish everything is one that has since been repeated ad nauseam by practically every unmemorable inspirational sporting film ever made . Nevertheless , Taylor is bright-eyed and enthusiastic , and she works well with Mickey Rooney , who was no stranger to being a child-star . Anne Revere plays a very important role as Velvet 's mother , once a famous athlete , who not only swam the English Channel but was lovingly-trained by none other than Mi Taylor 's own father . I liked that Mi was not told about this until the film 's final seconds , with Mrs. Brown correctly deciding that the young man would first need to develop his own sense of decency , rather than exploiting the memory of his late father for financial gain , as he would undoubtedly have done at the film 's beginning . The film reaches its climax at the Grand National Sweepstakes , where Velvet has , at the last moment , decided to ride her own horse , the Pi , in the world-famous competition . Under the guise of a Latvian male , she goes on , as expected , to win the race , but is later disqualified - either because she 's a girl , or because she tumbled from the horse before she was allowed to dismount ( what a stupid rule ! ) . This extended race sequence is exceedingly well-done , effectively capturing the nervous tension of those nerve-racking pre-race seconds , and the confusion of the event that places us in the same position as Rooney 's character , stranded behind tall spectators and waiting anxiously for somebody to provide an accurate update . It does n't really matter that we know it 's a stunt double doing most of the difficult riding - in several scenes , we can clearly see a creepy-looking man in a wig - but the positive message remains the same . I 'll wager that ' National Velvet ' has nurtured the imaginations of millions of young girls over the last sixty years , and it 's power to inspire has decreased little with time .

","Charlie ( George "" Norm "" Wendt ) and Rhonda ( "" Just Say "" Julie Brown ) are a pair of cheerful , murderous aliens who become stranded on Earth and stumble upon a tiny western town . They become deputy sheriffs and dish out a deadly form of justice to speeders , murderers and others , while getting on the bad side of some of locals ( led by Wayne Grace ) . Meanwhile , their sexy alien father ( Anastasia Sakelaris ) arrives in a skimpy/shiny outfit with her black human husband ( Christopher M.

147,"There are only a few movies which can be called ` must see ' and SHEPHERED is one of those films . In many ways it was ahead of it 's time ( and you can tell it was a source of inspiration for several better-known films ) Copied by many , equaled by none , this truly is one great movie . The story is complex but unfolds itself as a taut yet frequently amusing thriller and highly thought provoking exploration of the nature of humanity . The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where people must live underground and chaos reigns . C. Thomas Howell is a ` Shepherd ' one who protects the populace for various religious leaders by killing off any unfit members of the society . The whole idea made me think about our society . It 's really a brilliant social commentary , which is more than I can say for certain recent sci-fi/action blockbusters . MATRIX RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS did n't make one feel that any real innovation was taking place , just dull video-game effects . But SHEPHERD scores on the action scale too ... Not once does this movie let the viewer catch their breath . Peter Hayman proves himself to be one of the few genius action directors . We 're talking 100 % , high grade , down home kung fu fighting ! It was excellent . Really good special effects , shoot-outs , bleak-futuristic cyber-punk noir style the film really has its own elements . When talking about SHEPHERD , it 's impossible not to mention how much style it has . The vision of this city is really stunning . It recalls images of Tim Burton 's very memorable vision of Gotham in BATMAN . And these sights are photographed by Graeme Mears with a degree of skill that puts Gordon Willis and Conrad Hall to shame . Even the special effects proved amazing . Doubtless the scenes where fighting occurs are landmarks in all of filmmaking . This movie is a ballet of awesome visual display . Still , at the base of it all , there lies an interesting story , carried through by a strong cast . The acting ( especially Rowdy Piper ) and the plot are both great , and excellently directed . In contrast with loads of futuristic films made with a strong artificial flavor , the characters are believable and the dialogue is natural and full of wit . I 'm always proud to see a great film like SHEPHERD come along . It 's a damn shame that it did n't receive good distribution and made nothing in the box office . It 's a rarity worth searching for . This movie will impress you and make you feel 10 times cooler for having seen it ! ","There are only a few movies which can be called ` must see ' and SHEPHERED is one of those films .

153,"Just finished with Zombie Bloodbath part one on the amazing Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy DVD from CAMP Motion Pictures . Zombie Bloodbath 2 : Rage of the Undead is next . Now this one left me a bit puzzled due to a few plot holes and some confusing twists here and there , but it is a better film on many levels . Director Todd Sheets truly shows a major leap in style and talent between the two films . Again , this is not for people who want gloss and Hollywood style Horror films , this is for people who like their zombies bloody , raw and grainy . The story as far as I could tell , was basically about two robbers who in 1945 try and steal from an elderly couple only to find that the couple are members of a cult . One guy is simply killed and the other , the one in charge , is basically turned into a scarecrow and crucified and they stand him in the nearby field , still alive but dying . Cut to present day and a van full of college kids break down near a farmhouse . At the same time a group of convicts escape from a nearby jail . Both groups end up at the same house . The house was the one the elderly coupled used to live in and when one of the convicts knocks down the scarecrow and takes it 's jacket , it causes the scarecrow to wake up and he in turn brings the cult members back from the dead . Wow . And this is all in the first half hour . There is another plot also going on in town where a couple of serial killer types have taken some workers at a deli hostage .

It was obvious that Todd Sheets was truly trying to bring more to the table than a typical zombie film , and in that regard , he has succeeded . It had better special effects than the first film , great pacing and some cool music and visuals , plus there is a true show-stopper of a shot from INSIDE a mouth as a knife is jammed through it . Care was taken here and it shows . The weakness lies in the scripting and in a few of the lazier performances . Again , I recommend listening to the commentary track .

And they had already been editing the film by the time they got the film back , so some of the confusion is from a few scenes not being in the film . Also , I learned that Todd Sheets truly has a passion and love for making Horror movies . It shows . The film is a good example of no budget cinema that could have used one more rewrite , but still shines with more style than most DV films I see . Not quite as fun as the first film , though a better movie technically . I really admire Sheets as one of the true innovators and trailblazers in the area of DV cinema ... and this one is a great addition to the cheapo zombie genre ! ","Just finished with Zombie Bloodbath part one on the amazing Zombie Bloodbath Trilogy DVD from CAMP Motion Pictures . Zombie Bloodbath 2 : Rage of the Undead is next . Now this one left me a bit puzzled due to a few plot holes and some confusing twists here and there , but it is a better film on many levels . Director Todd Sheets truly shows a major leap in style and talent between the two films . Again , this is not for people who want gloss and Hollywood style Horror films , this is for people who like their zombies bloody , raw and grainy . The story as far as I could tell , was basically about two robbers who in 1945 try and steal from an elderly couple only to find that the couple are members of a cult .

The house was the one the elderly coupled used to live in and when one of the convicts knocks down the scarecrow and takes it 's jacket , it causes the scarecrow to wake up and he in turn brings the cult members back from the dead .

162,"The New Twenty is one of the worst films I have ever seen . Yes , some may argue that formulaic small budget films that strive for less may seem worse , but I would argue that a pseudo-intellectual anti-formulaic "" indie "" film that pretends to be more is worse . "" The New Twenty "" was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson , and I will never get back the 91 minutes of my life that I wasted on his film . THE SCREENPLAY & CHARACTERS From beginning to end , the screenplay failed to provide an anti-hero or hero with a moral core that the audience would want to see succeed or fail . In story telling , the three dramatic conflicts are man vs. man , man vs. the world , and man vs. himself . The screenplay focuses on a group of college friends in New York , and is preoccupied with the dynamic of man vs. himself , where each of the film 's characters are so self-absorbed in a stupor of depression and self-destructive behavior that the movie atrophies before the audiences very eyes . Each of the main characters indulge in unexplained bad behavior ( heroin addiction with no history as to why the character is an addict ; a fiancée who has sex with her fiancée 's boss/investor , even though the character is written too smart to have sex with such a sleazy character ; a man who begins as a decent guy , but is attracted to a foul-mouthed investor , and converts for some unknown reason into a similar foul-mouthed business jackass ; a closeted chubby gay cyber geek , who does nothing , but find dates online ; and a gay Asian man who dates an HIV positive older man , but has no scenes establishing why the relationship works and why love develops ) . Crucial scenes establishing the cause of the character 's addiction , the suffering and self - loathing of the fiancée that might explain why she would sleep with a sleaze bag ; the back story that would explain why a decent guy would be attracted to a "" Gordon Gecko "" type character and become a jackass ; a story line for the chubby cyber geek ; and more scenes of interaction between the Asian man and HIV positive boyfriend are all missing . Without proper establishing details , all of the characters ' actions seem forced and contrived . DIRECTION , CINEMATOGRAPHY & SCORE I found Mr. Johnson 's direction to be without a clear point of view , leaving the actors emotionally incoherent . The cinematography can be described as mundane at best . Mr. Johnson selected small spaces to shoot and failed to catch the grandeur of New York City . This failure created a claustrophobic film , that viewed like the filming of a stage play , and not a film . The score was embarrassingly absent from most of the film . I assume that Mr. Johnson is to blame , since he could have asked for full score to enhance understanding in each shot . CONCLUSION "" The New Twenty "" is an annoying and unmitigated failure in film-making . ","The New Twenty is one of the worst films I have ever seen . Yes , some may argue that formulaic small budget films that strive for less may seem worse , but I would argue that a pseudo-intellectual anti-formulaic "" indie "" film that pretends to be more is worse .

166,"Academy Awarding actor Sidney Poitier of "" Lilies of the Field "" reprises his role as Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs from the 1967 Oscar winning Best Picture "" In the Heat of the Night "" for veteran director Gordon Douglas ' tired , uninspired sequel "" They Call Me MISTER Tibbs , "" with nobody the equivalent of Rod Steiger with which to swap dialogue . Clearly , both "" Bullitt "" scenarist Alan R. Trustman and Robert D. Webb of "" Cape Fear "" were off their game when they penned this predictable police procedural potboiler . The dialogue is drab and none of the characters are interesting , not even the chief suspect . Absolutely nothing remotely exciting , suspenseful , or surprising occurs in this tame whodunit . Meanwhile , things have changed considerably since Virgil was last seen in "" In the Heat of the Night . "" He worked as a homicide detective for the Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , Police Department . In "" They Call Me MISTER Tibbs , "" our hero works for the San Francisco Police Department . Moreover , he has a wife , Valerie ( Barbara McNair of "" Change of Habit "" ) , and a family , a young rebellious son , Andy ( George Spell of "" The Naked Kiss "" ) , and a younger doting daughter , Ginger ( Wanda Spell of "" Hickey and Boggs "" ) . Tibbs drives a medium blue Mustang and his wife holds down the house and hovers over their two children since he does n't have as much time to spend with them . Literally , there are no surprises in this pedestrian murder mystery . Indeed , the best thing about "" They Call Me MISTER Tibbs "" is Quincy Jones ' terrific orchestral soundtrack with a memorable opening theme , more memorable than this forgettable crime thriller deserved . Everything begins sensationally enough with a struggling prostitute , Joy Sturges ( Linda Towne of "" The Adventurers "" ) , being bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of her downtown apartment by an unseen assailant . Apartment handyman Mealie Williamson ( Juano Hernandez of "" Intruder in the Dust "" ) enters Joy 's apartment and finds her strewn on the carpet dead with a bloody forehead . He picks up the statue briefly and then puts it back on the floor and reports Joy 's death to the superintendent of the apartment , Rice Weedon ( Anthony Zerbe of "" License to Kill "" ) , and Weedon gives Mealie and fistful of dollars and sends him packing . Afterward , Weedon anonymously notifies the SFPD that popular minister Logan Sharpe ( Martin Landau of "" Nevada Smith "" ) beaten Joy to death and was seem leaving Joy 's apartment . Captain Marden ( Jeff Corey of "" True Grit "" ) assigns Tibbs to handle the case ; it seems that both Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years . Naturally , Tibbs ' wife Valerie can not believe that the well-known , politically active evangelist could have committed such a crime . Just to give the movie context , it should be noted that when Tibbs and the police study the crime scene , they mention the word ' semen , ' no doubt a controversial term to mention in an early 1970s movie . Tibbs questions Weedon whom he suspects is either a drug pusher or a pimp . Weedon explains that he has no records on Joy Sturges because she was subletting the apartment from another realty company . Tibbs visits the realty company and realtor Woody Garfield ( Ed Anser of "" JFK "" ) flees and drives off , essentially doing an O.J. Simpson until he crashes his car after a lengthy but tame pursuit . When Tibbs proves that Woody did n't kill Joy , he allows him to leave , with his disgruntled wife , Marge ( Norma Crane of "" Penelope "" ) , prepared to file for divorce after the revelation that he paid a hooker to stay in an apartment . Tibbs tracks down handyman Mealie and clears him of the crime , and then he goes after Weedon . Luckily , for Tibbs , our hero catches the evil Weedon in the middle of a narcotics transaction . One of Weedon 's henchmen assaults Tibbs , but Tibbs dispenses with him briefly before he embarks on a long foot chase after Weedon . Eventually , he corners Weedon in an underground parking garage and they shoot it out . Guess who wins . The scenes in the Tibbs ' household are more interesting than his investigation . Andy runs rampant , striking his sister , and smoking in the garden . Our hero wants him to clean up his room . When Andy refuses , Tibbs pops him three times on the jaw . These child rearing scenes could probably never be handled today as they were back in 1970 . At the end of the movie , as if to solidify the family sequence , Tibbs is seen walking off with his wife and kids . There is on confrontation between Valerie and Virgil about the welfare of their children and how his long hours at work has affected them . Director Gordon Douglas directs in competent fashion . Surprisingly , for a film released in 1970 , the filmmakers never play the race card . In one scene , when Tibbs searches a billiards parlor owned by an African-American , we see a mixed breed of races scowling at the hero when he finds Mealie and leaves with him in tow .

Lovejoy is very good in the main role , but even he and the rest of the cast seem listless . Few surprises here and how did this film receive a Oscar nod for best documentary ? Rating , 4 . ",,
168,"This is a pretty simplistic romance . Girl finds boy , girl loves boy , girl loses boy , girl finds boy . Colleen Moore is the outstanding ingredient in this recipe , delivering a wonderfully varied dramatic/romantic performance , well deserving of an Oscar nom . Equally fine are the aerial combat special effects . Moore plays a French girl whose mother has turned over their field to a British aerial squadron during WWI . She is the "" daughter of the regiment "" , loved as a little sister . Into this mix comes a fill-in for a downed flyer , Gary Cooper . At first they hate each other , then they love each other , then the entire squadron is sent out on a suicide mission . Cooper returns but crashes in the village and a red cross unit removes him . Moore searches for him , is told at a hospital he is dead , then wanders the streets until he calls from a hospital window and they are reunited . It 's a nice little romance , but hardly more than that . Recommended for fans of Ms. Moore and Mr. Cooper ","This is a pretty simplistic romance .

169,"Now I do understand that this film was not meant as an indictment against all Indians but it is an amazing film because it dares to investigate the hypocrisy that some Indians have concerning their women and sexuality . I have known for some time that sexism is very common in this society ( with women being murdered because the husband 's family does n't want them any more after his death or because she had a small dowry as well as the frequent killing of female fetuses because they are seen as a curse instead of a blessing ) . I also realize that some from this culture will be greatly offended by the film , but the bottom line is that there is some truth to the subject matter -- even if the film was so strongly attacked when it debuted in India a decade ago . As a result of the extreme misogyny in the movie , most Western audience members will be shocked or at least be emotionally pulled into the plight of the ladies in this film . Although I am a male , am not rabidly feminist and I am straight , the film had a strong positive impact on me and it is NOT an agenda film that can only be enjoyed by Lesbians and "" man haters "" . In fact , I do n't think the film is promoting hatred of men or homosexuality but instead gives a credibly argument how in the case of these two ladies it was the only reasonable alternative due to their wicked husbands . Yes , I use the word "" wicked "" and mean it , as both husbands living in this large household are intensely selfish and have no regard for their spouses ' sexuality . In many traditional societies this is indeed the case and women are doomed to an empty emotional existence . One husband married a vivacious young woman , Sita , out of family obligation . This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning Sita makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband . However , he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about Sita -- and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady . To make matters worse , he did nothing to hide the affair and made no apologies . In their dead marriage , sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way Sita could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met . And unfortunately , he could have cared less . Another husband was married to a lady who was infertile ( Radha ) . Oddly , after initially trying to have children , they have gone the next 13 years without any sexual contact whatsoever ! It 's because this man has decided to become an ascetic ( i.e. , in Hinduism , a person who gives up the pleasures of the world to gain inner enlightenment ) . Now his wanting to do this was all well and good IF he was not already married and had obligations for his wife . However , being married , this was an incredibly selfish act and like his brother , he assumed his wife had no sexual feelings nor did he seem to care . The closest he would allow her to him sexually was to sleep next to him -- as having her next to him helped teach himself to "" overcome the desires of the flesh "" . This must have brought nothing but frustration to her . So , you 've got two neglected and normal women living in the same household who long for emotional connection as well as an outlet for their sexual needs . Eventually , these needs bring these sister-in-laws together -- at first , just emotionally but later sexually as well . The movie was brilliant how it got me to look at and understand how in some cases homosexuality is inevitable and even healthy compared to a life of emotional desolation . Late in the film , when the intensity of their sexual relationship is discovered , it leads to a not totally unexpected reaction from Radha 's "" enlightened "" husband -- a man who seeks religious insight and peace yet is so wrapped up in himself that true insight and growth is impossible . This is a very challenging and adult film . While there is very little nudity , the subject matter is very adult and this is not a film to show your kids . Very disturbing indeed is one minor character who masturbates in front of an old paralyzed lady -- as I said , this is NOT a film to let your kids watch . However , for a mature audience , this is an excellent and highly erotic film that will get you to think . The film features good acting , complex characters , excellent writing , lovely mood music and a slow pace that might annoy some , but which I found rewarding . The only serious negative I can not blame on the movie itself but on the idiots who released this on videotape . This is because although the movie is in English , the accents are quite strong at times and it 's not always easy to understand what 's being said . BUT , and this is the worst part , there are no closed or open captions -- including them is a must for Western audiences . If you do watch this film , see if you can find it on DVD or hopefully a newer release on video will have captioning -- mine sure did n't . By the way , director Deepa Mehta ( a popular female director ) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood . A consistent theme in her films is the conflict between traditional Indian culture and expectations and Westernism -- with a strong emphasis on female characters . Not surprisingly , this West-thinking lady makes her home in Canada and is divorced -- a truly unusual woman to say the least . For a similar film that explores traditional culture meets Western culture , try another Canadian gem , EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN .

172,"John Huston made many remarkable and memorable films . Those most often and easily recalled were released long before his passing in 1987 . It was that year , however , that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce 's acclaimed novella "" The Dead . "" Once long ago , a very wise man called Doc asked me , "" Does n't "" The Dead "" seem remarkably more vivid and bright than any of the other stories in Dubliners ? "" I tend to think that it is . The story and film both contain some of Joyce 's societal comments and criticisms , but for the most part , paint a warm and loving portrait of an Ireland Joyce himself so often railed against and would shortly leave . Huston 's handling of protagonist Gabriel Conroy , who realizes the world as he sees it is nothing more than an illusion , is simply remarkable . To claim that the film lacks plot is to miss the point . As with any of Joyce 's Dubliners , plot -- while most certainly present -- is not the focus . Plot is merely a tool for the conveyance of the protagonist 's epiphany . In addition to a seeming lack in action , there is quite frankly little dialogue in Joyce 's short story for the director to lean on . Huston 's ability to translate what Joyce puts in words into visuals is quite possibly the movie 's greatest triumph . Feelings , thoughts ... Gabriel 's discomfort during the dance ... all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer 's grasp in Huston 's portrayal . To claim that Huston has softened his writer 's criticism of society again misses the mark . While "" The Dead "" may be painted with a cheerful hue , the complacency and pretense of the film 's characters is but a comment on society on a smaller scale : we are the toddling old aunts ; the embarrassing drunk ; the tenor with the sore throat ; the wife with the sad , rain soaked secret ; even the self-deluded middle-aged man . But "" The Dead "" belies its title . It is not a dark story . Nor is it really that bleak . Forget for a moment the snow falling on the living and the dead and the inherent symbolism in it ; forget the shambles of a life Gabriel awakes to at the film 's end : it is only with the destruction of the illusions Gabriel has of himself and of his world that he can truly go forward .

Only thing , there is no farm , "" perfect "" or otherwise . The comedy involves how Elizabeth is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job . Elizabeth 's colleague , John , happens to have a farm in Connecticut , so that solves that problem . However , he wants to marry Liz , but she does not want to marry him . He offers her marriage , though he knows she does n't feel the same way about him that he does about her . He makes the offer anyway , and assures her that he is willing to wait . And here Barbara Stanwyck , as Liz , delivers one of the most devastating put-downs I have ever heard . With perfect innocence , she replies : "" Could you wait that long ? "" OUCH !

Great character work by all involved . Do n't miss this one ! ","Christmas in Connecticut is an absolute gem , and a must-see for Christmas ! Elizabeth Lane , a precursor to Martha Stewart , is a magazine columnist and the ne plus ultra of homemakers -- the perfect wife , uncle , and domestic goddess . Only thing is , she is none of these things -- a total phony . Unfortunately for her , she is about to be found out . Her publisher , Mr. Alexander Yardley ( a brilliant comic turn by Sydney Greenstreet ) gets the bright idea of inviting a famous war hero to Elizabeth 's "" perfect farm "" for the Christmas holiday . Only thing , there is no farm , "" perfect "" or otherwise . The comedy involves how Elizabeth is to keep her real identity under wraps so she will not lose her job . Elizabeth 's colleague , John , happens to have a farm in Connecticut , so that solves that problem . However , he wants to marry Liz , but she does not want to marry him . He offers her marriage , though he knows she does n't feel the same way about him that he does about her . He makes the offer anyway , and assures her that he is willing to wait . And here Barbara Stanwyck , as Liz , delivers one of the most devastating put-downs I have ever heard . With perfect innocence , she replies : "" Could you wait that long ? "" OUCH !

181,"I 've always liked Barbara Stanwyck who was , perhaps , the hardest working lead actress of the 30 's and 40 's although few of her movie roles are memorable . Today she is remembered most for the TV show "" The Big Valley "" . Stanwyck worked so much because she was durable ; it seems that she would accept most any role and make the most of it to make the movie a success and so directors loved her and many an ordinary picture gained credibility by her presence . And so it was for "" Christmas in Connecticut "" a very ordinary effort whose plot strains credulity and is n't even really about Christmas . It does , however , have Stanwyck and Dennis Morgan as well as some supreme character actors including Sydney Greenstreet and S.K. Sakall so there are plot twists and funny moments which undoubtedly seemed more real in 1945 than they do today . To begin , the plot concerns a magazine writer ( Stanwyck ) who the magazine 's readers believe is a domestic goddess , married with a child and living on a farm in Connecticut but who is really single , lives in New York City and knows nothing about cooking or homemaking . Could anyone get away with such a fraud even then ? Apparently , and even the owner of the magazine ( Greenstreet ) is deceived although one would think that he would have long since seen though the deception but the story moves on and Stanwyck , Greenstreet , a sailor recently survived from his sunken ship ( Morgan ) and Stanwyck 's restaurateur friend ( S.Z.Sakall ) find themselves spending Christmas in Connecticut at a farm belonging to Stanwyck 's boorish boyfriend ( Reginald Gardiner ) . You can imagine all the possibilities there are for this as the fraud unwinds as it must . Gardiner wants Stanwyck to marry him to perpetuate the rouse but one wonders how she can stand him at all . Morgan and Stanwyck fall for each other but he is supposed to be engaged and she is supposed to be married . Regardless , they begin what seems to be a make believe affair dancing cheek to cheek and stealing off in a horse drawn sleigh . Meanwhile , the incredibly naive Greenstreet character who has seen Stanwyck and Morgan go off together but still does n't get it sees one of the neighbors take back a child that has been borrowed as part of the deception and calls the cops to report a kidnapping . Stanwyck and Morgan are arrested for stealing the sleigh and the hoax begins to unwind . At this point the movie is funny as in ridiculous or absurd , not funny ha , ha and it routinely ends like screwball comedies always did . The good guy gets the girl and presumably they live happily ever after . I watch this movie every year at Christmas to enjoy these character actors at their best in a story that reflects way it was in 1945 and because of a long held fascination with Barbara Stanwyck .

There ` s nothing wrong with laddish characters but Stan and Jack are played by actors who seem to be in their late 40s / early 50s ! And there ` s something objectionable - not to mention crediblity defying - as they cop off with girls young enough to be their male daughters As for the rest of HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES , I found it instantly forgettable .

183,"Here 's a well-made war story , nicely shot and well-acted . The portraying of the Italian and German occupancy of Greek island Kefalonia is well-done . John Hurt as Pelagia 's father and the island doctor is superb , Nicolas Cage does a good job as the Captain from the title , Penelope Cruz does a good job of being beautiful and batting her eyelashes at Cage . There 's heroics and humor , there 's drama and romance , and it is all set on an idyllic island . Oddly enough , a very similar , or should I say almost identical , storyline , with the same characters going through the same series of events , is told in a novel by the same title , written by Louis de Bernieres . This wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful Pelagia , daughter of doctor Iannis , and their life on Kefalonia during WWII . Pelagia 's fiancee , local fisherman Mandras , enlists when the Italian Army invades northern Greece from Albania under false pretenses . When the Axis finally prevails , with a lot of help from the Germans , a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island , and Captain Corelli plays a big part in keeping the occupation a peaceful time . As Mandras joins the partisans , charming Corelli and his mandolin are quartered with the doctor and his beautiful daughter . Of course , this makes it a novel about love . But it is also a war novel , a summary of Greek history , a tale of Communist uprising in post-war Greece , a portrait of the madness of Mussolini , and , most importantly , an ode to island life on Kefalonia . Some of these elements return in the movie , but in general , it is an impossible book to film . I am glad nobody ever tried . The movie ' Captain Corelli 's Mandolin ' , however , is worth seeing .

184,"I 've watched this movie on a fairly regular basis for most of my life , and it never gets old . For all the snide remarks and insults ( mostly from David Spade ) , "" Tommy Boy "" has a giant heart . And that 's what keeps this movie funny after all these years . Tommy Callahan ( Chris Farley ) is the son of Big Tom Callahan ( Brian Dennehy ) , master car parts salesman , and has ridden on that all his life . But after his died dies on his wedding day , Tommy learns that the company is in debt , and about to be bought by Ray Zalinsky ( Dan Akroyd ) , the owner of a huge car parts company . So in order to save the company , Tommy has to go on the road to sell the company 's new brake pads . Along for the ride , though not by choice , is Richard Hayden ( David Spade ) a former classmate of Tommy 's who was Big Tom 's right-hand man . The movie rides on the chemistry between the two SNL stars ( and real-life best friends ) Chris Farley and David Spade . The duo has enough comic energy going between them to power the world . It 's the big , dumb guy versus the smart little guy . It works , and some of their scenes are unforgettably funny . Farley and Spade are actually decent dramatic actors as well . Although the film is primarily a comedy , it has its fair share of drama , but Spade and especially Farley are just as good there as when they 're making the audience laugh . Forgive me , but I have to talk about Chris Farley a little more . I read his biography ( "" The Chris Farley Show : A Biography in Three Acts , "" for anyone who cares ) , and understanding who Chris was in real life made this movie more special to me . Chris Farley was a genuinely good person who struggled , and ultimately failed to conquer his addictions . Although this was the first movie he had a major role in , it is his best film . It really showed who he was , and just how much talent he had . Knowing Chris 's story adds another layer to this movie , although it does n't make it any less funny . Farley and Spade are matched with a good on screen cast . Rob Lowe is suitably slimy as Tommy 's "" new brother , "" and Bo Derek is solid as his step-mother . Brian Dennehy is great as Big Tom . Dennehy makes it easy to believe that they 're father in son . Big Tom is just as crazy as his son , although he 's smarter and more mature . Dan Akroyd gives one of his best performances as Zalinsky , giving Tommy the hard truth behind advertising . Julie Warner is also good as Tommy 's love interest , Michelle . For me , Peter Segal is one of the great comedy directors . He keeps the pace quick and energetic , but most importantly , he knows how to make comedy funny . He does n't belabor the jokes , and he understands that funny actors know what they 're doing and he allows them to do it . But Segal goes a step further . He gives "" Tommy Boy "" a friendly , almost nostalgic tone that both tugs the heartstrings ( genuinely ) and tickles the funnybone . Critics did n't like "" Tommy Boy . "" Shame on them . A movie does n't have to be super sophisticated or subversively intellectual to be funny ( God forbid Farley and Spade were forced to do muted comedy a la "" The Office "" ) .

189,"In watching Enterprise for the first time , as we all no doubt do with all shows , I went into it with an open mind , enjoying about half of the past Star Trek efforts and disliking the other half . Enterprise has fallen short , but this episode "" A Night In Sickbay "" made me seriously question why I bother tivoing the shows from Monday night on Sci Fi . Masking some idea that it is one of those ' A Day In The Life ' episodes , in which we learn about what makes certain characters operate as humanoids , the writers seemed to forget that this was supposed to be a starship vessel , not the Ricardoes and the Mertzes . A planet , especially one whose people had been offended previously by the Enterprise crew ( for eating in public ) , was no place for a dog . As an animal lover myself , I would have never taken one of my pets into an environment that had proved in the past to be tense . But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these ST shows , constantly depicting things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures , as tho they are offering some insight into American religious zealots . The aliens were now offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree , yet the aliens were quite capable of taking the dog urinating as an insult . Strange how the dog 's urinating was n't regarded as some form of worship . I wonder how that one got by the show 's writers . From there , we are subjected to a captain who was misguided by his duties . In watching the episode , I found it very easy to forget that Bakula was supposed to be the ship 's captain . He chose to sleep in sickbay and from there we are given more inanities of behavior ( sigh ) that we are n't supposed to understand and that causes us to furrow brows . The doctor non-chalantly clips long , hairy toenails and feeds them to hungry caged animals . Ewwwwww ! Then a white bat creature escapes . Oh , how is anyone supposed to sleep with all of this going on ! Toenail clipping , for crying out loud ! I was waiting for something that feeds on vomit to be presented . Then we were inexplicably given some idea that the captain was in love with T'pol , and that perhaps he was masking those feelings with his concern over the dog . Endless amounts of rubbish . "" your dog is ill , so go have sex . You 'll feel better . "" And of course , the captain had to apologize and we humans had to regard his apology as completely ridiculous , because we are so ( everyone smile very sarcastically ) narrow-minded ! Saw depictions such as this endlessly droned out on TNG . Oddly enough , the only thing missing from this awful episode was that Trip person offering his smirks and downhome boyisms , tho Bakula seemed to be covering all of that with the silly dog . Oh , the dog survived , so now go play fetch .

A planet , especially one whose people had been offended previously by the Enterprise crew ( for eating in public ) , was no place for a dog . As an animal lover myself , I would have never taken one of my pets into an environment that had proved in the past to be tense . But what made this episode even more ridiculous was the endless problem with all of these ST shows , constantly depicting things that are sacred and insulting to other cultures , as tho they are offering some insight into American religious zealots . The aliens were now offended when the dog urinated on a sacred tree , yet the aliens were quite capable of taking the dog urinating as an insult . Strange how the dog 's urinating was n't regarded as some form of worship . I wonder how that one got by the show 's writers . From there , we are subjected to a captain who was misguided by his duties . In watching the episode , I found it very easy to forget that Bakula was supposed to be the ship 's <replaced> . He chose to sleep in sickbay and from there we are given more inanities of behavior ( sigh ) that we are n't supposed to understand and that causes us to furrow brows . The doctor non-chalantly clips long , hairy toenails and feeds them to hungry caged animals . Ewwwwww ! Then a white bat creature escapes . Oh , how is anyone supposed to sleep with all of this going on ! Toenail clipping , for crying out loud ! I was waiting for something that feeds on vomit to be presented . Then we were inexplicably given some idea that the captain was in love with T'pol , and that perhaps he was masking those feelings with his concern over the dog . Endless amounts of rubbish . "" your dog is ill , so go have sex . You 'll feel better . "" And of course , the captain had to apologize and we humans had to regard his apology as completely ridiculous , because we are so ( everyone smile very sarcastically ) narrow-minded ! Saw depictions such as this endlessly droned out on TNG . Oddly enough , the only thing missing from this awful episode was that Trip person offering his smirks and downhome boyisms , tho Bakula seemed to be covering all of that with the silly dog . Oh , the dog survived , so now go play fetch .

Mark , his family and friends are all fascinating characters , far more than any character created in last year 's fictitious cinematic products.This film oscillates on the dime between comedy , tragedy , touching sympathy and leads us ultimately to inspiring any viewer with an urge to create , despite talent issues , to get off their butts and make something . The film is about maverick artists and their passions . It is also about families , no matter how co-dependent and disfunctional they may be and how unique and beautiful that organism truly is . Mark proves in the film to be utterly devoted not only to his dreams , but also to his family as well - and they to him .

193,"Believe it or not , the Mona Lisa actually got stolen once , and was missing for nearly two years . In 1911 , Leonardo da Vinci 's ' La Gioconda ' ( better known as the Mona Lisa ) was taken from the Louvre by a petty thief ( and former Louvre employee ) who allegedly sought to return the world 's most famous piece of art to its native Italy . His actions after the theft make it seem more likely that he intended to sell the painting for his personal profit . ( Of course , he had no hope of finding a buyer . ) The Mona Lisa was quietly returned to the Louvre on the very last day of 1913 , remaining there ever since except for occasional loan-outs . When "" Arsène Lupin "" was released in 1932 ( twenty years after the theft ) , most moviegoers would have recalled that 1911 crime , and their knowledge would have lent some plausibility to this movie . "" Arsène Lupin "" is quite enjoyable , with MGM 's usual high production standards and Jack Conway 's usual briskly efficient direction . This movie does not lack for pleasure ; what it lacks is plausibility . John Barrymore is the master criminal of the title : he specialises in perpetrating ' impossible ' crimes , which he makes even more difficult by announcing them in advance ... but of course he always commits the crime and fools the gendarmes . Tully Marshall has a good scene as one of Barrymore 's victims . Lupin has a penchant for elaborate disguises , which enables Barrymore ( a U.S. ' Grade A ' ham ) to indulge his own penchant for tomfoolery . John 's older brother Lionel Barrymore is Guerchard , the Javert-like Surete detective sworn to catch Lupin . Karen Morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was filled with populist political activities ; on screen , she was most impressive in working-class roles that fitted her own political beliefs ( such as her fine performance in ' Our Daily Bread ' ) . In "" Arséne Lupin "" , Morley 's naturally dark hair is bleached a horrid blonde tone , and she 's all tarted up in posh outfits that make her look uncomfortable rather than sexy . SPOILERS COMING . Eventually , Lupin decides to steal the Mona Lisa from the Louvre . He slits the painting from its frame , rolls up the canvas , and then smuggles it out in a flower basket . We see John Barrymore casually brandishing a tightly-rolled piece of cloth which is allegedly the greatest work of art in all human history . I had to laugh at the filmmakers ' error . In real life ( but not in this movie ) , da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa on a plank of poplar wood , so a thief would have difficulty rolling it up ! Eventually , Guerchard captures Lupin and hauls him off to Le Calaboose . The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in the police car is sheer delight , as their genuine affection for each other spills out into their characters ' dialogue . I would have found this scene implausible with any two other actors . As it is , I ca n't imagine anyone but the Barrymore brothers playing these roles . Well , maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid , but just barely . Do n't look for a good plot line here , but "" Arsène Lupin "" is a delightful example of old-style movie-making .

194,"The topic of religion in Buñuel films is a point that one , as an eater of films , as an eater of art or as a person need to analyze hardly . One can see to a satirical Buñuel in "" La Voie Lactée "" , "" Un Chien Andalou "" or in "" L'Age d'Or "" . Is very hard and effective in its critic , but when you have seen this and then you see a movie like "" Nazarin "" , after you see this work you begin to be questioned about its author . And much have questioned about what seems to be a contradiction for Buñuel thinks , but is better not called in this way , i think that there 's not any contradiction in its work , only that Buñuel religion point of view is very diverse as unique in films . This beautiful film is based on the novel of Benito Perez Galdós , which told us the story of Father Nazario , who lived a humble , simple life dedicated to God and to help everyone . He lived in a simple and poor region . There lived too Beatriz , who is an abused and abandoned wife . She do n't find any sense of her life without her violent , macho man . She have a kind of repulse to him . In the other side is Andara , one of the towns prostitutes . Father Nazario has been stolen again , he blames to Andara 's cousin . Andara hear this and try to fight without success with the priest , who do n't believe in violence . That night , Andara find that her cousin is actually a thief , she have stole her bellboys . Andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences . With this , Andara search mercy from the priest . Nazario decides to help her , knowing well that this could be against his church , obviously this thing going to have some consequences . Since here , Nazario going to be a pilgrim . Without nothing , even without shoes , but with spirit and faith . But Andara and Beatriz want to be with he , and be like he , to serve God . If is the sweetest Buñuel film that i have seen so far , is too the most spiritual . Is clear here that the thing that most confuse people with the contradiction is that here , we do n't see a Buñuel against the power of church , we see a Buñuel whose film is about church but not in the typical - and great - satirical way . Whethever like it is , i do n't think that the right word is contradiction , actually i find it pleasant and well done and in spite of contain such religious issues ( As his "" Voie Lactée "" ) i found it more a spiritual film but that do n't try to touch in diversity the Catholic religion as maybe he touch , and laugh of it in another films . "" Nazarin "" is of father Nazario and its perspective front God and the same religion but all of this is at the end , analyzed in the spiritual life of this man . The other two women are , not a contrast , but as very well another two perspectives of faith . First we have Beatriz , the mistreated woman , that lose all the faith in life , first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family . This little girl was very sick . At side of her was too Andara , the prostitute who run of the justice . In the family of the child , just religious women , there a big pain , but faith becomes in father Nazario when he arrives with nothing to this town . He bless the child , a say later she is fine . The priest want go on walking , but Beatriz and Andara have recovered the faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to God with father Nazario . After some complains , father Nazario decide to be with them , discovering with some things until the end how he feels about faith , God , religion and the person in necessity , the people who must request to charity to survive . This last issue then must be noted as one possible explanation for the pineapple ending . This ending we listen the drums ( Similar to that in "" L'Age d'Or ) and a father Nazario , walking over asking about this things , when he refuse the fruit at the first time and at the end decide to receive it as a symbol of necessity or maybe , as an answer for its spiritual road that begin being priest . Meanwhile , the two women must take away of the father , Andara for its crime ( Beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps father Nazario in jail and then she damn the man who hit the priest in jail ) and Beatriz because she prefer be with her macho man , in spite that he treat her bad , just because she do n't accept that she fall in loved with the priest . Father Nazario - and here is maybe the unique place in film to critic church - walk to contradict the church , the religion that he serves . Father Nazario is that then , is a ( Soft for much , but not for me ) critic for some thing in religion ( Father Nazario helping a women who is guilty of a crime , of a sin ) but most of all is one of Buñuel analysis of faith and life , and he really got it , with a beautiful , tender , sweet and unforgettable film , that is , without a doubt , one of his best . * Sorry for the mistakes ... well , if there any .

Is clear here that the thing that most confuse people with the contradiction is that here , we do n't see a Buñuel against the power of church , we see a Buñuel whose film is about church but not in the typical - and great - satirical way . Whethever like it is , i do n't think that the right word is contradiction , actually i find it pleasant and well done and in spite of contain such religious issues ( As his "" Voie Lactée "" ) i found it more a spiritual film but that do n't try to touch in diversity the Catholic religion as maybe he touch , and laugh of it in another films . "" Nazarin "" is of father Nazario and its perspective front God and the same religion but all of this is at the end , analyzed in the spiritual life of this man . The other two women are , not a contrast , but as very well another two perspectives of faith . First we have Beatriz , the mistreated woman , that lose all the faith in life , first with her husband and then with a little girl who was in her family . This little girl was very sick . At side of her was too Andara , the prostitute who run of the justice . In the family of the child , just religious women , there a big pain , but faith becomes in father Nazario when he arrives with nothing to this town . He bless the child , a say later she is fine . The priest want go on walking , but Beatriz and Andara have recovered the faith in life and want to dedicate their lives to God with father Nazario . After some complains , <replaced> Nazario decide to be with them , discovering with some things until the end how he feels about faith , God , religion and the person in necessity , the people who must request to charity to survive . This last issue then must be noted as one possible explanation for the pineapple ending . This ending we listen the drums ( Similar to that in "" L'Age d'Or ) and a father Nazario , walking over asking about this things , when he refuse the fruit at the first time and at the end decide to receive it as a symbol of necessity or maybe , as an answer for its spiritual road that begin being priest . Meanwhile , the two women must take away of the father , Andara for its crime ( Beautiful scene where she thanks a man who helps father Nazario in jail and then she damn the man who hit the priest in jail ) and Beatriz because she prefer be with her macho man , in spite that he treat her bad , just because she do n't accept that she fall in loved with the priest . Father Nazario - and here is maybe the unique place in film to critic church - walk to contradict the church , the religion that he serves . Father Nazario is that then , is a ( Soft for much , but not for me ) critic for some thing in religion ( Father Nazario helping a women who is guilty of a crime , of a sin ) but most of all is one of Buñuel analysis of faith and life , and he really got it , with a beautiful , tender , sweet and unforgettable film , that is , without a doubt , one of his best . * Sorry for the mistakes ... well , if there any . ","The topic of religion in Buñuel films is a point that one , as an eater of films , as an eater of art or as a person need to analyze hardly . One can see to a satirical Buñuel in "" La Voie Lactée "" , "" Un Chien Andalou "" or in "" L'Age d'Or "" . Is very hard and effective in its critic , but when you have seen this and then you see a movie like "" Nazarin "" , after you see this work you begin to be questioned about its author . And much have questioned about what seems to be a contradiction for Buñuel thinks , but is better not called in this way , i think that there 's not any contradiction in its work , only that Buñuel religion point of view is very diverse as unique in films . This beautiful film is based on the novel of Benito Perez Galdós , which told us the story of Father Nazario , who lived a humble , simple life dedicated to God and to help everyone . He lived in a simple and poor region . There lived too Beatriz , who is an abused and abandoned wife . She do n't find any sense of her life without her violent , macho man . She have a kind of repulse to him . In the other side is Andara , one of the towns prostitutes . Father Nazario has been stolen again , he blames to Andara 's cousin . Andara hear this and try to fight without success with the priest , who do n't believe in violence . That night , Andara find that her cousin is actually a thief , she have stole her bellboys . Andara fights with her cousin with terrible consequences . With this , Andara search mercy from the priest . Nazario decides to help her , knowing well that this could be against his church , obviously this thing going to have some consequences . Since here , Nazario going to be a pilgrim . Without nothing , even without shoes , but with spirit and faith . But Andara and Beatriz want to be with he , and be like he , to serve God .

195,"Babette 's Feast and "" The Horse 's Mouth "" are the two most insightful , accurate films on what it is to be a real artist . The key lines in "" Babette 's Feast "" are not , as some other commentators here have said , "" an artist is never poor , "" but two lines that come before and after it : "" I was able to make them happy when I gave of my very best . ... Throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist : give me the chance to do my very best . "" I spent nine years producing experimental multi-media music theater in San Francisco , raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers , actors , designers , etc. , and the artists I supported stretched every penny in their effort to do their very best . They were just like Babette : they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work . Babette 's art is fine French cooking , and for her to perform her art at its very best costs 10,000 francs . When , after years in political exile from France , isolated with two caring spinsters on a bleak Scandinavian coast , she suddenly gets a windfall of 10,000 francs , she does what every real artist would do : she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best , and so she does it . She spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist . The twist in the movie is that we do n't know she is such an artist , until she is actually cooking and serving the meal . Up until then , she appears to be just a working-class French lady who haggles a bit with the tradesmen , and is very serious ( her husband and son were murdered in Paris violence in 1871 ) . To such an artist , it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it . That is why the author set this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly have any understanding of what they are receiving . Babette did not cook this meal as a gift to the two spinsters , or to the religious community . It was not her goal to achieve a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the little religious sect . Indeed , she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them . After the meal , she is sitting alone , sipping some wine , not paying the slightest attention to how the guests reacted . She is basking in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist . That is why it is so satisfying , and so important to the story , that the General unexpectedly shows up -- for , as Babette knows instantly , a general will know what she has placed before him , and will appreciate it . For there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art being shown to an audience that lacks even one person competent to appreciate it . She is glad , very glad , he came , in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions during the entire dinner , the only one she singles out for special treatment -- not either of the spinsters . But she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it . To anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real first-class Parisian dinner , as I have ( my father was Naval Attache to Paris in the 1980s , and I had my honeymoon in France ) , this dinner , and Babette 's satisfaction in making it , and the pleasure it brings to the diners , is absolutely convincing . If any art has the power to suffuse the recipient with a sense of joy , it is a fine French meal cooked and served in France . This movie makes a claim about the transformative effects of great art on the recipients . Before the dinner , the members of the little religious sect are quarrelsome , dredging up old resentments . The old hymns fail to restore good fellowship ; people ignore them , talk over them . But the shared experience of sensual great art -- for the people can enjoy the tastes of the foods and wines even if they have no conception that they are experiencing great art -- contents the people , puts them in a forgiving mood , reconciles them , and by making them happy , encourages them to love each other , and thus has a god-like sacred effect of bringing peace . This is the claim found in the modern art movement today -- that art can supplant the traditional religions in making mankind more peaceful . Thus , contrary to those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian belief , it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that Christian ritual can not . After all my years in the art world , I have to say that this claim -- that art brings peace that religion can not -- is overblown and invalid . But it is a pretty conceit and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film . One last note : at Babette 's arrival at the spinsters ' home , a particular French general , Galliffet , is named as the person who in 1871 executed Babette 's husband and son , and imposed a military rule that she had to flee . At the end of the film , as the General tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in Paris many years before ( before 1871 ) , at the conclusion of some military maneuvers , it turns out that this same Galliffet was his host at the meal . As the General tells the story , French general Galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman , the only woman he would risk his life for . Of course , that woman was Babette . Thus , ironically , the same French general who said he honored Babette above all other women was responsible for driving her away from France forever .

At the end of the film , as the General tells the story of the magnificent meal he enjoyed in Paris many years before ( before 1871 ) , at the conclusion of some military maneuvers , it turns out that this same Galliffet was his host at the meal . As the General tells the story , French general Galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman , the only woman he would risk his life for . Of course , that woman was Babette . Thus , ironically , the same French general who said he honored Babette above all other women was responsible for driving her away from France forever . ","Babette 's Feast and "" The Horse 's Mouth "" are the two most insightful , accurate films on what it is to be a real artist . The key lines in "" Babette 's Feast "" are not , as some other commentators here have said , "" an artist is never poor , "" but two lines that come before and after it : "" I was able to make them happy when I gave of my very best . ... Throughout the world sounds one long cry from the heart of the artist : give me the chance to do my very best . "" I spent nine years producing experimental multi-media music theater in San Francisco , raising money for productions that involved dozens of singers , actors , designers , etc. , and the artists I supported stretched every penny in their effort to do their very best . They were just like Babette : they were desperate to get every dollar necessary to do their very best work . Babette 's art is fine French cooking , and for her to perform her art at its very best costs 10,000 francs . When , after years in political exile from France , isolated with two caring spinsters on a bleak Scandinavian coast , she suddenly gets a windfall of 10,000 francs , she does what every real artist would do : she sees that she unexpectedly has the chance to do her very best , and so she does it . She spends all the money so that she can do her very best work as an artist . The twist in the movie is that we do n't know she is such an female artist , until she is actually cooking and serving the meal . Up until then , she appears to be just a working-class French lady who haggles a bit with the tradesmen , and is very serious ( her husband and son were murdered in Paris violence in 1871 ) . To such an artist , it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art that is competent to appreciate it . That is why the author set this dinner in a community of people who could not possibly have any understanding of what they are receiving . Babette did not cook this meal as a gift to the two spinsters , or to the religious community . It was not her goal to achieve a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the little religious sect . Indeed , she never once leaves the kitchen to speak to any of them . After the meal , she is sitting alone , sipping some wine , not paying the slightest attention to how the guests reacted . She is basking in the satisfaction of finally having the chance to have done her best as an artist . That is why it is so satisfying , and so important to the story , that the General unexpectedly shows up -- for , as Babette knows instantly , a general will know what she has placed before him , and will appreciate it . For there is a sort of tragedy in a great work of art being shown to an audience that lacks even one person competent to appreciate it . She is glad , very glad , he came , in fact he is the only guest she ever mentions during the entire dinner , the only one she singles out for special treatment -- not either of the spinsters . But she did not plan the meal knowing that such a person would come to receive it . To anyone who has had the chance to enjoy a real first-class Parisian dinner , as I have ( my father was Naval Attache to Paris in the 1980s , and I had my honeymoon in France ) , this dinner , and Babette 's satisfaction in making it , and the pleasure it brings to the diners , is absolutely convincing . If any art has the power to suffuse the recipient with a sense of joy , it is a fine French meal cooked and served in France . This movie makes a claim about the transformative effects of great art on the recipients . Before the dinner , the members of the little religious sect are quarrelsome , dredging up old resentments . The old hymns fail to restore good fellowship ; people ignore them , talk over them . But the shared experience of sensual great art -- for the people can enjoy the tastes of the foods and wines even if they have no conception that they are experiencing great art -- contents the people , puts them in a forgiving mood , reconciles them , and by making them happy , encourages them to love each other , and thus has a god-like sacred effect of bringing peace . This is the claim found in the modern art movement today -- that art can supplant the traditional religions in making mankind more peaceful . Thus , contrary to those commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian belief , it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can heal wounds that Christian ritual can not . After all my years in the art world , I have to say that this claim -- that art brings peace that religion can not -- is overblown and invalid . But it is a pretty conceit and it is the second main theme of this beautiful film .

198,"As Salinger 's "" A Perfect Day for Bananafish "" ends with the suicide of a prodigy , this movie opens with the death of the star high school swimmer legend , Matt , who shoots himself in the head with a revolver after in the opening scene . But the death of Matt Travis serves as a key to unlock the door of another prodigy , his brother , Tim who never in his life seriously bothered with the question , "" What am I going to do ? "" When he finds his brother dead , his head broken like a dropped watermelon , the Travis family starts vomiting out its secrets one by one . The film focuses on Tim . He is a victim of bullying , domestic abuse , family alienation , heartbreak , issues of sexuality and friendship . Tim reveals his wounds by physical bruises , but these are not the only injuries to his person , as we slowly come to realize , as the script painfully unveils the origins and outcome of Tim scars . Everyone who loves him hurts him . Hirsch plays out the character quite well , revealing frame after frame in the visual expression of his body , a host of conflicting emotions inside the soul of a kid whom no one seems to listen to or know very well , unknowing and unaware of his depth of soul and prodigious talent . Two siblings sharing a doobie , curled up on a red , spinnable playground saucer , Tim asks Penny , "" What am I going to do with the rest of my life ? "" The scene is framed in a familiar , recurring image of the film : the comfortable playground where Tim obviously feels at home , filmed from a bird 's eye view , because with every character Tim feels comfortable to share a part of himself , and we view these intimate moments he shares in the red , spinnable playground saucer , complete with childish graffiti carved in pencil , from above . After advising him curtly to pass the joint , Penny tells him , "" Tim , well , the secret to the success of life is to find something you love . And you have to do that for the rest of your life And you better hope to hell that you 're good at it because if you 're not then you 'll probably fail . "" This simple line of advice from Penny serves as the movie 's central theme , the responsibility of talent and the possibility of failure . Why does one person have a talent he can not stand , like Matt , who hated the attention his swimming fame brought , but no one notices Tim 's talent no one because no one bothers to ask him ? Not even us . The film makes us aware that we ourselves do not know Tim as well as we thought we did when we first meet this handsome , sad , guy ; in our intimate understanding of Tim , as it progresses , we are reminded that not everyone is as they seem to be . This is the other side of the film , the failure of those who should parents , friends , teachers whoever to notice and see the gifts of the people they claim to love . Not even his mother Sandy , played by Sigourney Weaver , sees Tim 's gift , despite her love for her son . Weaver does a deft job of a middle-aged woman grappling with her own inner demons as she haphazardly tries to play the roles of domesticity and support . When Tim is found to be bullied at school , she storms the boy 's trailer , threatening his life , "" You can tease , torture , punch , drive drunk with me , I can forgive you . Hell I can understand it , I 'm a good Christian , you know , I can forgive and forget , but you mess with my kid and may God himself descend from heaven to protect you because as long as I live and I will outlive you all I will wake up and go to sleep at night just dreaming of ways to make your petty insignificant lives into hell on earth . "" After flicking a paper cup into the mother 's face , she looks around the trailer , and looking at them both , the kid and his stunned mother , comments , "" nice trailer "" and leaves as quickly as she came . Weaver scores in her ability to match gusto with visceral wit that is acid and witty . And Tim 's father , played by Jeff Daniels , is blind to who his son is , treating him like a stranger , not telling his family that he took time off from the office , spending his days in the city park , listless , a carved out soul , and sleeping in Matt 's bed , tucked in with his high school letter jacket . Jeff Daniels does a superb job of making us believe that he can be both a bastard and lovable because , we grow to see that even an inept father can show his love for his son . In an emotional scene , Tim confronts his father . Just when you think his dad is going to hit him , he grabs for him to embrace him . Not letting him go , he tells Tim , "" I am your father and you 're are my son and I 'm here okay but you 've got ta talk to me . I do n't know how to do this by myself "" . It is here at this moment in the film that a father tells his son , you have to tell me what 's going on inside of you , you have to tell me who you are ; I want to know who you are . It is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment , the visual movement from Tim , angry and alone , to his father embracing him as he breaks downs and weeps , revealing the emotions hidden beneath his shell . Tim experiences this moment of cleansing with his dad as a catharsis , especially when you consider the mistreatment , manipulation , disregard , violence and betrayal he has been dealt in the long year the film encompasses .

Scott is as good as I 've seen him , showing more with a flick of an eye than a lot of female actors can do in a paragraph of dialog , and the rest of the cast is uniformly fine . The inevitable showdown between Shaw 's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary , and a surprise even for a longtime Lang devotee such as myself ; and even in 1941 it seems there was no place more fraught with meaning on the margins of civilization than the barbershop and the dusty street outside . You can get a shave , you can feel like a new man , but you ca n't really ever be one as long as the old ties are still holding you back . Genius . ",,

202,"Can a film be too faithful to the book upon which it is based ? Judging from the time-spanning 2007 adaptation of Khaled Hosseini 's huge 2003 seller , the answer is rather ironically "" yes "" . Like many , I was enthralled by the book , an impressive first effort by the Afghan-American writer/physician . So obviously were director Marc Forster ( "" Stranger Than Fiction "" ) and screenwriter David Benioff ( "" Troy "" ) , who pay meticulous attention to the most significant details of the story within the film 's 127-minute running time . Yet , the seamless tapestry of heartfelt events in Hosseini 's novel often comes across as episodic and truncated because Forster and Benioff are sincerely trying hard to remain true to the full scope of the story within the time constraints . Part of the challenge is how Hosseini carefully used symbolic acts to provide literary , then-and-now symmetry to what is essentially a three-act story , a technique that can come across as somewhat contrived on screen . However , the filmmakers do the most important things right , specifically giving the viewer an intimate look into a hidden culture heretofore conveyed through CNN news reports , ensuring authenticity by having characters speak in the Dari Persian dialect of the Afghan language , and capturing the emotional entanglements of the complex narrative . The first part of the movie is set in 1978 Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion and the eventual takeover of the Taliban . The focus is on the relationship between Amir , the son of an affluent businessman named Baba , and the devoted Hassan , the son of his father 's servant . Connected by their mutual love of kite running , the two are thick as thieves until a tragic event separates them irreparably . Unable to find the courage that comes so naturally to his father , Amir is crippled by guilt for not having rescued Hassan from an unspeakable act performed by a trio of local bullies . Forster makes especially palpable the ethnic tensions between the Hazara and the Pashtun in Afghanistan . Upon the 1979 invasion by Soviet troops , Amir and Baba flee to the U.S. where the story picks up their story nine years later in Fremont , California , a suburban enclave of Afghan émigrés . Baba is reduced to working in a gas station and operating a flea market kiosk . Amir meets a local Afghan girl and marries . This is the film 's least interesting passage since Benioff 's treatment gives short shrift to ancillary characters like Amir 's wife Soraya and most critically , Amir is portrayed by necessity as a reticent young man with a downward cast toward his self-esteem . The final section flashes forward twelve years where Amir , upon publication of his first book , is summoned back to Taliban-dictated Afghanistan to rescue Hassan 's son from the Taliban , as a means to atone for his cowardice years earlier . There is true suspense and fear generated in this portion of the story as shocking revelations and old acquaintances come back to haunt Amir during his journey . A British actor of Egyptian heritage , Khalid Abdalla ( the lead hijacker in "" United 93 "" ) has the central role of Amir as an adult , a challenging role since he has to convey a constant sense of shame and diminished self-worth until the end . The other professional actors fare better - Shaun Toub ( Tony Stark 's savior Yinsen in the current "" Iron Man "" ) as Baba 's business partner Rahim Khan , who holds the key to the truth ; Atossa Leoni quietly affecting as Soraya ; and best of all , Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi who brings pride and dignity to Baba . Three young non-professionals were recruited from Kabul 's school system to play the key child roles , and all are quite good . Zekeria Ebrahimi is up to the challenge of the toughest part as young Amir , and Ali Danish Bakhtyari is poignant as Hassan 's nearly catatonic son Sohrab . But it 's the sad-eyed , moon-faced Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada who will break your heart as the young Hassan , especially in the devastating pomegranate-throwing scene . It 's fair to say his performance is on par with the young Enzo Staiola 's in Vittorio de Sica 's classic "" Bicycle Thieves "" . The technical aspects are well done , in particular , Roberto Schaefer 's clean cinematography ( western China convincingly substitutes for Afghanistan ) , Alberto Iglesias ' evocative score , and even the CGI effects showcasing the kites in turbulent flight . The 2008 DVD has a solid set of extras beginning with an insightful commentary from Forster , Hosseini , and Benioff , although some of their dialogue seems rather forced . There are two featurettes included - the first is the 14-minute "" Words from the Kite Runner "" , which focuses on Hosseini 's connection to the story and the development of the novel , and the second is the 25-minute "" Images from the Kite Runner "" , a more standard behind-the-scenes look at the production . Rounding out the extras are the original theatrical trailer , a few previews , and a PSA from Hosseini on how to help the Afghans during their current time of need .

205,"When I first saw Colleen Moore it was in the excellent series about silent films called "" Hollywood "" . There she was in 1980 , her hair defiantly bobbed as it was in the Twenties , a sparkling , witty and charismatic elderly lady - the very definition of "" presence "" . Then I saw her fabulous silent comedy work in films like "" Ella Cinders "" and "" Orchids and Ermine "" . Then the disappointingly sombre talkie "" The Scarlet Letter "" . And now here she is in "" The Power and the Glory "" giving a performance of staggering power , working expertly alongside one of the talking cinema 's finest actors - Spencer Tracy . I found the movie a little lack lustre story-wise , but Moore and Tracy give such brilliant performances that the story hardly seems to matter . Both actors age from youth to old age in the course of the film - and this is done mostly through acting alone with minimal make-up and hair changes . Moore is almost unrecognisable as the elderly wife , and the scene where she finds out her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most magnificently performed scenes I have ever seen . She does most of the scene without dialogue , which is where her silent acting experience gives her the edge , even over Tracy . Contrast this with her delightful comic playing in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and Tracy is struggling to propose to her . Astonishing ! What this film reveals more than anything else is how shameful it is that Hollywood let this remarkable actress slip through its fingers and spend most of her life in retirement .

208,"This is a movie that will leave you thinking , is he or is n't he ? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending , it gives room for the audience to think and interpret it from the signs . This is my interpretation and theory , and I believe it is very sound . First , here is the plot . One day , Prot ( Kevin Spacey ) suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station . After attempting to help a woman from muggers , he is arrested and sent to Bellevue , and later transferred to Dr. Mark Powell 's ( Jeff Bridges ) hospital . Prot freely talks about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to do a report on Earth . Naturally , he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward . He befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story . In fact , he tells them he can take one person back with him . Soon Dr. Powell is beginning to question Prot 's insanity and as the plot progresses , it is harder and harder to prove Prot wrong . In the end , Dr. Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter , a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in New Mexico , when his wife and daughter were murdered . Prot claims that he plans to leave for K-Pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the murders . The time comes and goes , and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state . One of the patients is missing and is never found again . On to my theory : Prot is not crazy . Prot is from the planet K-Pax . Robert Porter is a friend of Prot 's . On one of Prot 's previous visits to Earth , Robert was a child , learning about the constellations from his father . Prot and Robert became best friends . After the death of his family , and Robert slaying the murderer , Robert decides to commit suicide . Prot is on K-Pax at the time , but he rushes back ( in multiples of light speed ) to stop Robert . So Prot takes over the thinking of Robert , taking over his body so to speak . Awhile later , Prot ( still inhabiting Robert 's body ) comes to New York and is locked up . When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27 , he takes Bess with him , but he must leave Robert 's body behind . Hence , we now have the catatonic Robert . Explanations or clues : PROT 'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA : As Prot says , any child knows about their own system . Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system , and Prot added to their knowledge . Robert Porter , while smart and knows his constellations , was no astro-physicist . DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT : It 's true . Prot could 've left the institute at any time , but chose not too . Prot 's last words to Dr. Powell are , "" Now that you 've found Robert . Take care of him . "" Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left . SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES : It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays . Prot provides his usual K-Pax reason , but there was no Earthly reason given . It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect . HELPING THE PATIENTS : Throughout the movie , you see Prot helping the other patients ( or the patients discussing Prot 's suggestions ) to a better sane world . While the psychologist balk at Prot 's help , Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading . THE SPRINKLER SCENE : The sprinkler is associated with Porter 's home in New Mexico ( which is ironically where Roswell is ) . Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family ? Is her trying to protect Powell 's daughter from that horrible fate ? I have a different point of view . It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river . Indeed , Prot ( under hypnosis ) is greatly concerned about Robert . I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water , not the sprinkler . He is trying to protect the girl from watery death , like he did Robert . HYPNOSIS : Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot 's true identity , but while Prot gives plenty of information , he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K-Pax . THE SECURITY CAMERA : Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason ? MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES : First , Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north . Funny , the patients are not at all alarmed . Indeed , they try to reassure the doctor . Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff . Naturally , the most telling disappearance is of Bess , the winner of the essay contest . Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time , but the only remaining clue is her winning essay . This is only my humble theory . You can conclude what you want . You can take Dr. Powell 's theory , that Prot was merely a persona taken up by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality , but that would be giving up too many plot holes .

So Prot takes over the thinking of Robert , taking over his body so to speak . Awhile later , Prot ( still inhabiting Robert 's body ) comes to New York and is locked up . When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27 , he takes Bess with him , but he must leave Robert 's body behind . Hence , we now have the catatonic Robert . Explanations or clues : PROT 'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANETS AROUND LIBRA : As Prot says , any child knows about their own system . Only a few people on Earth had an inkling about the system , and Prot added to their knowledge . Robert Porter , while smart and knows his constellations , was no astro-physicist . DR POWELL FEELS CHOSEN BY PROT : It 's true . Prot could 've left the institute at any time , but chose not too . Prot 's last words to Dr. Powell are , "" Now that you 've found Robert . Take care of him . "" Prot was probably staying there to ensure a place for Robert when he left . SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES : It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays . Prot provides his usual K-Pax reason , but there was no Earthly reason given . It was also mentioned that Prot was given extremely high doses of medicine with no effect . HELPING THE PATIENTS : Throughout the movie , you see Prot helping the other patients ( or the patients discussing Prot 's suggestions ) to a better sane world . While the psychologist balk at Prot 's help , Dr. Powell talks at the end of the movie about the new lives the patients are leading . THE SPRINKLER SCENE : The sprinkler is associated with Porter 's home in New Mexico ( which is ironically where Roswell is ) . Does Porter associate the sprinkler with the death of his family ? Is her trying to protect Powell 's <replaced> from that horrible fate ? I have a different point of view . It is assumed that Porter had committed suicide in a river . Indeed , Prot ( under hypnosis ) is greatly concerned about Robert . I believe that Prot associates the danger with the water , not the sprinkler . He is trying to protect the girl from watery death , like he did Robert . HYPNOSIS : Dr. Powell feels that under hypnosis he can uncover Prot 's true identity , but while Prot gives plenty of information , he never gives up his Prot persona and claimed homeland of K-Pax . THE SECURITY CAMERA : Why would the camera just give out for no apparent reason ? MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES : First , Prot disappeared for a few days to his trip up north . Funny , the patients are not at all alarmed . Indeed , they try to reassure the doctor . Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff . Naturally , the most telling disappearance is of Bess , the winner of the essay contest . Not only does she disappear at the approximate same time , but the only remaining clue is her winning essay . This is only my humble theory . You can conclude what you want . You can take Dr. Powell 's theory , that Prot was merely a persona taken up by Robert Porter to mentally defend himself from reality , but that would be giving up too many plot holes . ","This is a movie that will leave you thinking , is he or is n't he ? While many people have complained about the ambiguous ending , it gives room for the audience to think and interpret it from the signs . This is my interpretation and theory , and I believe it is very sound . First , here is the plot . One day , Prot ( Kevin Spacey ) suddenly appears in the midst of a busy train station . After attempting to help a woman from muggers , he is arrested and sent to Bellevue , and later transferred to Dr. Mark Powell 's ( Jeff Bridges ) hospital . Prot freely talks about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to do a report on Earth . Naturally , he is classified as a looney and is locked up in a low security level ward . He befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story . In fact , he tells them he can take one person back with him . Soon Dr. Powell is beginning to question Prot 's insanity and as the plot progresses , it is harder and harder to prove Prot wrong . In the end , Dr. Powell learns that Prot is Robert Porter , a smart man who worked in a slaughter house in New Mexico , when his wife and daughter were murdered . Prot claims that he plans to leave for K-Pax at a precise time on the fifth anniversary of the murders . The time comes and goes , and Powell finds Prot or Robert in a catatonic state . One of the patients is missing and is never found again . On to my theory : Prot is not crazy . Prot is from the planet K-Pax . Robert Porter is a friend of Prot 's . On one of Prot 's previous visits to Earth , Robert was a child , learning about the constellations from his father . Prot and Robert became best friends . After the death of his family , and Robert slaying the murderer , Robert decides to commit suicide . Prot is on K-Pax at the time , but he rushes back ( in multiples of light speed ) to stop Robert . So Prot takes over the thinking of Robert , taking over his body so to speak . Awhile later , Prot ( still inhabiting Robert 's body ) comes to New York and is locked up .

209,"The murders in Opera are not actual murders as much as they are symbols of past events and parts of Betty 's own fractured personality . In fact , Betty is the same person ( a male ) that Suzy Bannion is in Suspiria , only a decade later in life ( Suzy was a boy of ten who befriended another boy of ten with a more mild version of his own background ) . It helps to think of Betty 's luxury apartment as a military barracks bay ; she spends most of her time in her bedroom in bed next to her stereo it seems , and other parts of her apartment seem foreign to her somehow , as though other people live in those other rooms . Dario Argento 's movies sync with a wide array of Rock music , as well as Funk ( Dario starts the syncs right at the beginning of his films , the flash of the eye in Opera , and the start of a drum roll in Suspiria ) .

These syncs , along with many others reveal Betty to be a male who suffered sexual torture at the hands of his father since birth ( even in the womb according to a certain Anne Rice novel entitled Lasher ) . Anyway , large budget films are occult works which relay spy information collected by occult means , all in synchronized symbolic/alchemical fashion . Usually , the sync point in a film is the beginning of the sound score , or it is the first image of the film beyond any film company lead-in . Sometimes it is more creative . The heavy metal music used in Opera and Phenomena are simply music syncs that were deciphered out of other films that Argento 's movies sync with , an intellectual game of sorts among the elite within the industry .

215,"This is the first film I 've watched from the Italian Ed Wood , Demofilo Fidani aka Miles Deem . The above title was superfluously added later on since there exists another similarly titled 1961 movie starring Richard Basehart which was Hammer Films ' Michael Carreras ' one and only stab at the Western ; the genuine Italian title was originally translated as HIS NAME WAS SAM WALBASH , BUT THEY CALLED HIM AMEN although it was actually WALLACH in the Italian variant which , of course , implies a tribute of sorts to Hollywood actor Eli ! While certainly not unwatchably bad , instances of clumsiness and ineptitude abound so that I was often cracking up into howls of laughter : a horrid number by a would-be irresistible French chanteuse ; a totally irrelevant bar-room brawl ; actors doing somersaults when being shot ; an aged villager doing an impromptu dance routine ; ineffective use ( indeed abuse ) of slow-motion ; and , easily the most preposterous , seeing Gordon Mitchell and Lincoln Tate play two gunfighters ( sporting the actors ' own names ! ) hired by the villain to kill off the title character and then never having them appear in the rest of the film at all !!

220,"It is impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou 's ` Hero ' to Ang Lee 's ` Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon . ' They were both big-budget Chinese kung-fu films with breathtaking cinematography of Chinese landscape and a cast of super-stars . But aside from the obvious , there is in fact nothing else to compare . ` Hero ' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters , proving that big-name stars , beautiful scenery , and action effects are no replacement for a director 's artistry and vision . All the marketing hype preceding the premier of ` Hero ' has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one . Much anticipated , ` Hero ' drew movie-goers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong , making it an instant box-office success . However , though the script pleased government censors , Chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain . On-line critics , both professional and amateur , proclaimed the film ` ideologically disturbing , ' ` from the viewpoint of deep servitude , ' written ` either by an amateur historian , or someone with ulterior motives . ' One article was simply titled , ` Hero , you make me sick ! ' The deepest failing of the film is in its plot , which is not only morally reprehensible , and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but - worst of all for a film - is boring ! All blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history , but ` Hero ' goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as Stalin or Hitler . ` Hero ' does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun . Instead , it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being ` deep ' and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy . Though historians agree that the First Emperor of China was ruthlessly violent , Mao Zedong was known to have admired this ruler - no surprise , given Mao 's own tyrannical rule . Likewise , the Communist government in Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the First Emperor and its own iron-fist methods , so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by Zhang Yimou . Tony Leung , one of the stars of ` Hero ' remarked during an interview to promote the film that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the student demonstrations , because it was needed to maintain ` stability ' in China . For these remarks , Tony Leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of Hong Kong , but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie . Director Zhang Yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and movies , to reveal a higher wisdom . Unfortunately , his version of ` wisdom ' turns out to be : THE OPPRESSOR IS RIGHT . In China , where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through , art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny . The great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world : one where kung-fu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice , free from fear and winning against all odds with their super-human skills . Only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in China , and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions . Going against this tradition of the kung-fu hero , Zhang Yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth , as he had hoped , but downwards , to the level of government propaganda . It 's no wonder the government was so pleased . Some film lovers may secretly wonder , ` All moralistic judgments aside , is it at least entertaining ? ' Fortunately , the answer is a resounding ` No ! ' Because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations , it becomes tedious to watch . Moreover , the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development , since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the ` real ' version emerges . The film is not without its beautiful images . However , all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline . The use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived , and the cinematography appears self-consciously rather than truly beautiful . Great for a trailer , but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film . For those in China who showed disdain for ` Crouching Tiger 's ' unrealistic kung-fu , much was expected from ` Hero . ' Jet Li , who plays the title role , is a real kung-fu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor . His previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities , but many hoped that Zhang Yimou could use Li 's lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities . But it was not to be . ` Hero ' attempts to go beyond the kung-fu genre , so there are not many fighting scenes , and Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting : an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice . As the casting director ought to have expected , Li fails miserably . Meanwhile , the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung-fu skill is the first one of the film , between Li and and Donnie Yen . All the scenes that follow are a disappointment , so ` Hero ' fails to satisfy , even on that level . Though most audiences outside China are unlikely to be aware of the historical mangling of the story of the cruel First Emperor , it seems even more unlikely that they would accept Zhang 's version of ` Chinese wisdom , ' which is anything but . Perhaps the only time an audience coming out of a screening of ` Hero ' was seen smiling - instead of yawning or frowning - was at the special screening for Chinese government officials . ","It is impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou 's ` Hero ' to Ang Lee 's ` Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon . ' They were both big-budget Chinese kung-fu films with breathtaking cinematography of Chinese landscape and a cast of super-stars . But aside from the obvious , there is in fact nothing else to compare . ` Hero ' fails to deliver on almost every level that really matters , proving that big-name stars , beautiful scenery , and action effects are no replacement for a director 's artistry and vision . All the marketing hype preceding the premier of ` Hero ' has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one . Much anticipated , ` Hero ' drew movie-goers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong , making it an instant box-office success . However , though the script pleased government censors , Chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their disdain . On-line critics , both professional and amateur , proclaimed the film ` ideologically disturbing , ' ` from the viewpoint of deep servitude , ' written ` either by an amateur historian , or someone with ulterior motives . ' One article was simply titled , ` Hero , you make me sick ! ' The deepest failing of the film is in its plot , which is not only morally reprehensible , and based on unforgivable historic fallacy but - worst of all for a film - is boring ! All blockbuster epic films are known to take some liberties with the facts of history , but ` Hero ' goes beyond artistic license into unforgivable ignorance when it attempts to glorify an emperor that was as brutal as Stalin or Hitler . ` Hero ' does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun . Instead , it is makes a woefully poor attempt at being ` deep ' and merely manages to be pretentious and preachy . Though historians agree that the First Emperor of China was ruthlessly violent , Mao Zedong was known to have admired this ruler - no surprise , given Mao 's own tyrannical rule . Likewise , the Communist government in Beijing sees the allegory that can easily be drawn between the First Emperor and its own iron-fist methods , so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by Zhang Yimou . Tony Leung , one of the stars of ` Hero ' remarked during an interview to promote the film that the Beijing government had done the right thing in 1989 by crushing the <replaced> demonstrations , because it was needed to maintain ` stability ' in China . For these remarks , Tony Leung received shocked criticisms in his home city of Hong Kong , but he merely stated out loud the underlying message of the movie . Director Zhang Yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass the values of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung-fu novels and movies , to reveal a higher wisdom . Unfortunately , his version of ` wisdom ' turns out to be : THE OPPRESSOR IS RIGHT . In China , where thousands of years of historical reality have rammed this message through , art was the last sanctuary where the individual could actually find freedom from such tyranny . The great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to provide an escape into an alternate world : one where kung-fu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice , free from fear and winning against all odds with their super-human skills . Only in the novel did the individual ever win over institutionalized power in China , and only in the novel did the oppressed find their champions . Going against this tradition of the kung-fu hero , Zhang Yimou has not gone upwards towards a higher truth , as he had hoped , but downwards , to the level of government propaganda . It 's no wonder the government was so pleased . Some film lovers may secretly wonder , ` All moralistic judgments aside , is it at least entertaining ? ' Fortunately , the answer is a resounding ` No ! ' Because the same tale is told over and over with only slight variations , it becomes tedious to watch . Moreover , the three conflicting versions of the same story serves only to confuse the character development , since it leaves precious little time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them once the ` real ' version emerges . The film is not without its beautiful images . However , all the scenes fall flat because they do not connect to or enhance the storyline . The use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the tale comes across as simplistic and contrived , and the cinematography appears self-consciously rather than truly beautiful . Great for a trailer , but a disappointment once you are there to watch the entire film . For those in China who showed disdain for ` Crouching Tiger 's ' unrealistic kung-fu , much was expected from ` Hero . ' Jet Li , who plays the title role , is a real kung-fu artist who held national titles before beginning his career as an actor . His previous movies have revealed limited acting abilities , but many hoped that Zhang Yimou could use Li 's lithe body movements to full effect while casting him properly in a role that would not task his acting abilities . But it was not to be . ` Hero ' attempts to go beyond the kung-fu genre , so there are not many fighting scenes , and Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult piece of acting : an inner transformation leading to profound wisdom and self-sacrifice . As the casting director ought to have expected , Li fails miserably . Meanwhile , the only fighting scene that reveals any true kung-fu skill is the first one of the film , between Li and and Donnie Yen . All the scenes that follow are a disappointment , so ` Hero ' fails to satisfy , even on that level .

However I put it off far too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments like "" extremely boring "" or "" nothing happened "" "" a complete waste of time "" . But when I saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith I was allowed to see a glimpse of the exquisite experience that is 2001 : A Space Odyssey . There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to rent that movie the same evening . It turned out to be the greatest visual experience of my life . Of course , watching a very good painting or picture can be wonderful , but watching a movie constructed with the same kind of virtuosity in every frame adds a whole new dimension to it . My god ...

That does n't mean however that I reject these fast-paced societies or that I look down on them ( and neither does Kubrick ) but only that they can be so much more if only people would stop for a moment and take a little time to absorb the sheer beauty of the world we live in . And what better opportunity is there to do this then by slowing down to the elegant pace of this film and to let yourself be taken to that place between waking and dreaming . When we go to this place it is possible to get a so called "" natural high "" . It is something that our spirit can do whenever we meet pure and boundless beauty . And never in my life has this "" natural high "" or "" spiritual orgasm "" as it is called by some or "" samaddhi "" by others been more intense . Yes it 's more intense than a regular orgasm ... several times more intense actually . Many religions have claimed that this particular feeling proves that they are right . Are they right ? For me a straight answer to such a question would only detract from the impenetrable mesmerizing mystery of the universe . In my opinion the film tries to convey the same mystery through the depiction of the black monolith and by stating the following about it : "" Except for a single very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter the four-million year old black monolith has remained completely inert . Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery . "" The trance that Bowman experiences is the same thing I experience when watching those gorgeous visuals .

The doubt and discomfort that is subsequently caused will make us point to our deeper intellectual activity as the source of all this trouble , while in fact we only have our easy answers to blame .

231,"I have recently become a huge fan of Patton Oswalt . I think he 's the most deliciously original comedian to come along in ages . He is refreshing and fearless in his routines , which run the gamut of topics from how much Bush sucks to the sleazy exploits of 1970s producer Robert Evans . I 'm a longtime fan of Maria Bamford and her wide-eyed innocent/schizophrenic routine . Whenever she effortlessly switches her naturally high-pitched voice to one that is clipped and throaty , I ca n't help but giggle . I liked Brian Posehn long before I even knew he was on "" Just Shoot Me "" , and there is something so innately funny about his aging nerd persona . All three of these talented , unique comedians headline "" The Comedians of Comedy "" , a Netflix documentary about their U.S. tour . They truly deserve to be stars , and this tour gave them the recognition they so richly deserve . I thought , no , I KNEW I 'd like this movie ... But I was wrong . Instead of the three comics each getting their own routine segments , "" The Comedians of Comedy "" is bogged down by meandering and dull documentary scenes that contain no humor , no insight , nothing of real interest . I think there is a total of 30 minutes of intermittent stand-up routines total in the 109 minute movie . What a rip-off ! Come on , is anyone really interested in seeing our stars banter in their RV ? Where 's the humor in seeing Posehn in an arcade and a comic book shop ? Does anyone find random diner scenes particularly funny ? If this movie could n't have shown our comics strutting their stuff , at least make it about what life is like on the road . It 's not even about that . Worst of all , the comics never appear to be having real fun . Oswalt admits how bored he is doing a radio interview , Posehn sheepishly admits to how much he sucks at giving a tour of his home , and Bamford nervously improvises every time the camera is pointed at her , and her humor there is only sporadic . Sheesh , these guys deserve a chance to show the world their unconventional , amazingly crafted humor that is a refreshing change of pace from the brainless entertainment of mainstream comics like Dane Cook . Instead , we have to sit through their mundane , everyday routines on the road in a substandard bore of a movie whose quality could easily be surpassed by any student film . If you can locate any of Oswalt 's , Posehn 's , or Bamford 's performances on DVD , by all means do . Their talent should be a joy to behold , not a chore like it is here .

233,"In Sri Lanka , a country divided by religion and language , the civil war between the pro-Sinhalese government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , a separatist organization , has claimed an estimated 68,000 lives since 1983 . Human rights groups have said that , as a result of the war , more than one million people have been displaced , homeless or living in camps . The impact on children and families caught in the conflict is sensitively dramatized by acclaimed Tamil director Mani Ratnam in his 2002 film A Peck on the Cheek , winner of several awards at the National Film Awards in India . While the civil war is merely a backdrop for the story of a young girl 's voyage of discovery , the human cost of war is made quite clear and Ratnam gives the fighting a universal context , pointing the finger at global arms traffickers as the source of wrongdoing . Beautifully photographed in Southern India by cinematographer Ravi K Chandran in a setting mirroring the terrain of Sri Lanka , the film tells a moving story about an adopted 9-year old girl who sets out to find her real mother in the middle of the fighting in Sri Lanka . Played with deep feeling and expressiveness by P.S. Keerthana in a memorable performance , Amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama ( Nandita Das ) and Dileepan ( J.D. Chakravarthi ) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out , leaving her in a Red Cross camp . In a loving flashback , we see Amudha 's adoptive parents , father Thiru ( Madhavan ) a prominent Tamil writer , and mother Indra ( Simran ) a TV personality , marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girl . Young Amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday , according to the parents ' prior agreement . While she is playing , Thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that "" you are not our daughter "" and the response is predictable . Distraught , she questions who her father was , what her mother 's name was , why she gave her up , and so forth but few answers are forthcoming . Amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her true mother , now a fighter for the Tamil separatists . The family 's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions , handled mostly with skill by Ratnam , though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish . A Peck on the Cheek is of course a Bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama . The melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors ; however , I found the musical dramatizations of songs by A. R. Rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick , high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing . Yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film 's limitations . Tamil cinema has been criticized by many , even within the country as being too clichéd and commercial , yet A Peck on the Cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues . That it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute .

Keerthana in a memorable performance , Amudha is brought up by a loving middle class family with two younger brothers after her natural parents Shyama ( Nandita Das ) and Dileepan ( J.D. Chakravarthi ) were forced to flee when the fighting broke out , leaving her in a Red Cross camp . In a loving flashback , we see Amudha 's adoptive parents , father Thiru ( Madhavan ) a prominent Tamil writer , and mother Indra ( Simran ) a TV personality , marry to facilitate their adoption of the darker-skinned little girl . Young Amudha has no idea that she is adopted until it is sprung upon her abruptly on her ninth birthday , according to the female parents ' prior agreement . While she is playing , Thiru tells her almost in a matter of fact tone that "" you are not our daughter "" and the response is predictable . Distraught , she questions who her father was , what her mother 's name was , why she gave her up , and so forth but few answers are forthcoming . Amudha runs away several times until her parents agree to go to Sri Lanka to help her find her true mother , now a fighter for the Tamil separatists . The family 's immersion in the reality of the civil war leads to some traumatic moments and difficult decisions , handled mostly with skill by Ratnam , though a sequence where the family was caught in a crossfire felt amateurish . A Peck on the Cheek is of course a Bollywood-style film and that means tons of music and melodrama . The melodrama did not get in the way because of the strong performances by the lead actors ; however , I found the musical dramatizations of songs by A. R. Rahman counter to the mood of the film with their slick , high production techniques and fast-paced music video-style editing . Yet the compelling nature of the story and the honesty in which it is told transcend the film 's limitations . Tamil cinema has been criticized by many , even within the country as being too clichéd and commercial , yet A Peck on the Cheek is both a film of entertainment and one that tackles serious issues . That it successfully straddles the line between art and commerce is not a rejection but a tribute . ",,

248,"Julie Delpy stars in this horrific film about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France of the 14th Century . The film attempts to shatter the romantic chivalry image of the heroic medieval knight , by showing a rather dreary image of the period , defined by psychological dysfunction , and violence . The movie opens with a child , François , growing up in the shadow of the Hundred Years ' War , told by his father to keep his mother safe and to wait for his return . François takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed . François murders him in the name of defending his father 's honour . Like father like son , François grows up , and leaves his family , also to go to the same war . This setting is somewhat of an explanation for the events to come , as on his way home , we already notice that something is wrong with François . The war has not done well with him , he has changed . The daughter , Béatrice de Cortemart ( Delpy ) , awaits her beloved father , to return from captivity of the English . She is pure of heart and she was left to take care of the estate while her father was gone . In her father 's absence , Béatrice needs to deal with financial difficulties , which strengthens Béatrice 's hope that her father will return to save her . But , upon his return , she notices that he lost the will to enjoy life , and he tortures and humiliates everything around him , even his own daughter . From this points the film depicts various ways how François torments his family . Starting with humiliating his own son , and ending with the rape of his own daughter , Béatrice . Setting the film in the Middle Ages supposed to soften the blow , as the viewer may tell himself , that these kind of violent acts were held in difficult times . And indeed , many films on the topic of Incest , such as Tim Roth 's "" The War Zone ( 1999 ) "" which are contemporary were more shocking because of that . Delpy appears in this film in several daring nude scenes . Indeed she appears to be angelic and beautiful . I was annoyed when I saw some animal torture scenes . I believe , and this is not confirmed , that some birds were killed for the making of this film , which really upsets me . The quality of a film drops when real violence is used towards animals . I would hope that this movie will be re-released without those cruelty scenes . Those scenes do not contribute much to the film storyline . Overall , the movie is too long . The script is problematic . We do n't get to see François and Béatrice before the war , we do n't really get the answer why is he changed to such extreme . I would have pass on this film , however , I have to mention a few scenes that made this film worth watching : * Scenes of a young child being able to murder in cold blood is truly shocking . I saw it first time on "" City of God ( 2002 ) "" . Here , François , murders his mother 's lover , while his father away at war . Excellent scene and very graphic . * The scenes from Béatrice being raped by her father till she finds out she is pregnant from him are truly shocking and interesting . The scene after the rape , where Delpy burns her cloths and cleans herself . She asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with hopes to have a miscarriage . * The brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his son 's head into the food - humiliating him then ranting about the war . Later , dressing his son with women 's cloths . The film won the César ( French Oscar ) for Best Costume Design , I agree , the costumes here really make the film look authentic for the time period . The movie location is Château de Puivert , a real 12th century castle and a historical monument , located in Aude , South-Central France . Beautiful castle and mountain view , really helps you set into the period of this film . The film also nominated for 3 more César awards , but they were all snatched to the widely successful French film "" Au revoir , les enfants "" ( "" Goodbye , Children "" , 1998 ) . --- Released as "" Beatrice "" in New York City , March 1987 .

252,"The Gymnast ( 2006 ) was written and directed by Ned Farr . Dreya Weber portrays Jane Hawkins , a former world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist . The promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around Jane 's accidental reunion with a former teammate . Although this meeting takes place , that plot line is secondary to the main plot , which involves Jane , her husband , and a professional dancer named Serena ( Addie Yungmee ) . The two women develop an act of the type performed by Cirque de Soleil . The two complement each other -- Jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength . Serena is more elegant and artistic , although , obviously , also capable of incredible physical feats . The film works because we can understand how Jane would turn to Addie , who is caring and compassionate , while Jane 's husband has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage . Both women are incredibly fit and athletic , and Dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts . They clearly are truly performing their act , and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed , be a success in Las Vegas , or anywhere else they traveled . The sexual tension between the women is obvious , and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air . A woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation , which is n't resolved in a neat and tidy fashion . Of the six films we saw at the Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival , we thought this one was the best . It will work on DVD , and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen . NOTE : Stay for the credits ! ","The Gymnast ( 2006 ) was written and directed by Ned Farr .

A woman with a neglectful husband and an attractive woman partner make for an explosive situation , which is n't resolved in a neat and tidy fashion . Of the six films we saw at the Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival , we thought this one was the best . It will work on DVD , and is definitely worth seeking out on large or small screen . NOTE : Stay for the credits ! ","The Gymnast ( 2006 ) was written and directed by Ned Farr . Dreya Weber portrays Jane Hawkins , a former world-class gymnast who was seriously injured and now earns her living as a certified massage therapist . The promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges around Jane 's accidental reunion with a former teammate . Although this meeting takes place , that plot line is secondary to the main plot , which involves Jane , her husband , and a professional dancer named Serena ( Addie Yungmee ) . The two women develop an act of the type performed by Cirque de Soleil . The two complement each other -- Jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body strength . Serena is more elegant and artistic , although , obviously , also capable of incredible physical feats . The film works because we can understand how Jane would turn to Addie , who is caring and compassionate , while Jane 's brother has taken her for granted for the many years of their marriage . Both women are incredibly fit and athletic , and Dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are characteristic of gymnasts . They clearly are truly performing their act , and the results are so excellent that we can believe they would indeed , be a success in Las Vegas , or anywhere else they traveled . The sexual tension between the women is obvious , and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air .

254,"I 'm impressed that ' Hail the Woman ' was made at all ; released just one year after American women got the vote , this turgid drama makes an earnest plea against the sexual double standard which judges women 's sexual behaviour more harshly than men 's . SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD . A prologue , set in the Plymouth colony in 1621 , shows a Pilgrim girl sentenced to the ducking stool for flirting with a boy ; the boy is not penalised . Now we come to Flint Hill , New Hampshire in the present ( 1921 ) . Oliver Beresford ( Theodore Roberts ) is a bombastic bible-thumper : what we call in Britain and Australia ' a God-botherer ' . Beresford is determined that his son David ( Lloyd Hughes ) become a preacher , regardless of how David feels about it . As for Beresford 's daughter Judith ... well , Beresford is confident that women are n't important enough to be anything more than wives and mothers . Apparently , God told him this personally . David 's evangelical career is compromised when he impregnates Nan Higgins , the stepdaughter of the local odd-jobs man . ( Tully Marshall 's character is identified in the credits solely as the ' Odd Jobs Man ' , but a close-up of a cheque reveals his name to be Jake Higgins . The prejudices of 1921 require that he be merely Nan 's stepfather , not her biological parent . ) To save his son from scandal , Beresford buys off Nan 's stepfather with a cheque . Nan goes off to the big city , to melt into oblivion as one more unwed mother . Judith is naturally dismayed by the limitations imposed upon her by her gender . ( Or rather , by other people 's perceptions of it . ) She meets Wyndham Gray ( excellent performance by Edward Martindel ) , an author who encourages her to transcend sexist stereotypes . But Judith is informally engaged to local lout Joe Hurd , who wo n't put up with such nonsense . Hurd is played by Vernon Dent , a burly performer now remembered solely for comedy roles ( as a second banana to Harry Langdon , and as a villain in Three Stooges movies ) . He gives an excellent performance here , in a role outside his usual range . Sadly , in real life Dent spent his final years in poverty and total blindness due to diabetic retinopathy . Eventually , Judith ends up working at an orphanage . This being 1921 , I expected the orphanage to be whites-only , so I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to include one Chinese boy . ( And unpleasantly surprised when he 's used as the butt for a racial joke . ) The movie makes one odd error here . In a Christmas sequence , we see the orphanage mistress reciting ' A Visit from Saint Nicholas ' ... but ( in a dialogue title ) she credits Santa Claus with SIX reindeer rather than eight . This is followed by a brief animation sequence , showing Santa with six reindeer hitched to his sleigh . I assume that the animators ( either by accident , or to save money ) left out two reindeer , and the title card revised the poem to match the error . Lloyd Hughes was generally a bland and unimpressive actor . His most famous performance is his role in ' The Lost World ' , where he 's easily upstaged by a rampaging brontosaurus . For his climactic scene in ' Hail the Woman ' , Hughes gives a memorable performance as he finally rebels against his father 's tyranny . In his performance as the gospel-shouting father , Theodore Roberts has been accused of overacting to the point of making his role a caricature . I disagree : sadly , decades after this film was made , I continue to encounter ' holy ' fools exactly like this man ... willing to destroy the lives of everyone around them , and firmly convinced they have God 's authority to do so . In the central role of Judith Beresford , Florence Vidor gives a sensitive , realistic and intelligent performance . I normally dislike Vidor , who tended to be cast in glamour roles but was n't pretty enough to justify them . Here , her character 's physical appearance is less relevant than usual . This entire film is impressively directed by John Griffith Wray , a director who deserves to be much better known . Sadly , Wray died at the onset of the talkies era , in his mid-thirties : had he lived another ten years , he would surely have helmed several early sound classics . In ' Hail the Woman ' there are several extremely beautiful screen compositions : I was especially impressed by a scene in the New England forest , when Vidor and Dent have a quarrel in front of an enormous uprooted tree .

255,"The Brave One is about a New York radio show host named Erica Bain ( Jodie Foster ) . Her life is a dream living in the city she grew up in and loves . She has her great fiancé David ( Naveen Andrews ) , whom she is planning to marry . But one night while Erica and David are out walking their dog , they are attacked and mugged by a group of degenerates , leaving David dead . Erica recovers but is heartbroken and traumatized later on , and can barely cope with real life anymore . She buys a gun off a guy on the streets for protection . But one day she 's shopping in a store , and a man comes in and shoots the clerk dead . It is then that Erica shoots and kills this man , and she becomes a vigilante . Killing anyone who tries to threaten or harm her or any others . At the same time Detective Mercer ( Terrence Howard ) is tracking down this elusive unknown killer , and in the process becomes friends with Erica . Erica begins to regain her sanity as she kills these violent people , but is unsure of whether or not what she 's doing is morally right . And as her and Mercer become closer , he does n't even realize the unknown murderous assailant is right next to him . Jodie Foster gives a very good performance in The Brave One . She portrays this type of violent , morally corrupted character brilliantly . Terrence Howard is also great in this movie . Both have excellent chemistry together , and strengthen the film to a certain level . The Brave One looks visually pristine , and conveys some brilliant camera work , but not all of it works to a great effect . The scenes where Erica is absolutely traumatized and afraid to walk out her front door to face the world . The camera swayed back and forth to the sides in an almost dream-like way , and really captured the moment with essence . Whereas almost every time Erica killed somebody , everything just had to go slo-mo and show her facial expressions in fine detail . The slo-mo was properly used when Erica committed her first murder . But why keep doing this effect almost every time she committed murder ? The camera work creates a great atmosphere in most of the film , but there a few scenes here that are just plain overkill . The Brave One is very much about how these murders affect Erica emotionally . Her fiancé is killed by a group of thugs , and suddenly her love of New York City is turned upside down . She realizes that there is a dark side to the beloved city , and she says so on her radio show . I do n't completely understand this though . Erica acts as if she never realized that violence can occur at night in the city , and that 's pretty stupid . If she lived there all her life she must be either blind or very oblivious . Erica also seems to be a glutton for inhumane , murderous people . She really does n't even have to go look for them , they just to come to her as if they 're begging to be shot dead for their wrong-doing . The Brave One deals with the morals and proper use of violence strongly at first , and then suddenly it glorifies it . The ending is very negative , and completely immoral and inhumane . It also negates the purpose of Terrence Howard 's character , which the movie spends so much time trying to evenly develop , and suddenly his morals take a U-turn . The morals in The Brave One become very fractured , and just plain shatter all over the place by the end . So violence is okay ? It 's a good thing to commit murder as long as it 's for vengeance ? I pretty much refuse to believe that . You know why ? Because I have a conscience , which this film surely lacks . It is not right to take the life of another person , no matter how bad they are , or how much you hate them . Erica Bain sets out to stop these evil-doers , but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills . Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard provide a lot of strength for this movie . The Brave One contains a strong message , but that message is both immoral and wrong . This movie may look pretty , well acted , and intelligently strong . But it becomes pretty rotten by the end .

Jason has since moved behind the camera , forming the production company , Unconditional Entertainment . He recently wrapped filming on his latest movie , which stars Cuba Gooding , Jr. and Ray Winstone . And all this has nothing to do with being the son of Sean Connery . If you think Jason said to Sean , "" daddy , I wan na be in Macbeth movie that they are going to film , "" and Sean said , "" sure , son , whatever you say , "" and made a phone call and got his son the role , you are mistaken . In fact , Jason Connery is being cut out of his father 's will . Seeing as how his father is Sean Connery , that 's a big chunk of change Jason will be losing out on . The reasoning behind the decision is apparently Sean 's strong feelings that his only niece should learn to provide for himself . The relationship has become fairly strained , with Jason even threatening to change his name . ------------------------------------ Of being the son of Sean Connery , "" I realize that I 'm always going to be compared to my father . There are innuendos all the time . Should I spend my whole life justifying myself ? "" ------------------------------------ So stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being able to act just because he is son of Sean Connery ( big deal ! ) . Watch Jason in Bullet to Beijing and you 'll form a different opinion about his acting ability . ",,

But , the key word is seemingly , for while it lacks the bravura pop psychologizing of Persona and the gaudy horror film homages of Hour Of The Wolf , it is one of the best films ever made about war - and not as an anti-war film , nor a pro-war film . As such , it has to rank with Wild Strawberries as one of his greatest films , as well as one of his best screenplays , if not the best .

261,"*** SPOILERS *** Well made and interesting film about the alienated youth of America back in the 1950 's . Back in those days many parents caught up with making big bucks and living high on the hog forget that their children , especially teen-agers , needed a lot more then a car and and hefty allowance in order to feel part of the family . They also needed love and attention , to their growing up problems , which is what 16 year-old Hal Ditmar , James MacArthur never got from his successful movie producer dad Mr.Tom Ditmar , James Daly . Never really connecting with his dad Hal grows more and more distant from both him and his caring mom Helen Ditmar , Kim Hunter , as well as from society . After his dad put Hal down about him wanting to borrow his car , a late model luxury sedan , he and his friend Jerry , Jeffery Silver , drive in Hal 's beat up and barley operational 1930 's jalopy to the local treater to catch the latest western flick . Feeling like striking out at the world Hal acts like a real first-class jerk sticking his smelly feet almost into the faces of a couple , Eddie Ryder & Jean Corbett , sitting in front of him and Jerry trying to watch the movie . This leads Hal , as well as his friend Jerry , to not only be kicked out of the theater but with him belting the theater manager Mr. Grebbs , Whit Bissell . It turned out that at least Hal was willing to leave the theater , without even getting his money back , but when Grebbs tries to grab him Hal wheeled around and belted him right in the kisser . Hal now in real hot water , he 's charged with assault and battery , put 's on his "" James Dean "" act , at the local police station , making like he 's either too cool or just plain stupid to realize what he 's done ; almost knocked Mr. Grebbs teeth out . It 's when Sgt.Shipley , James Gergory , tells Hal that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally sobers up to the fact of what he 's done . The rest of the film has Hal try to straighten himself out but is unable to do that because the low esteem that his dad has of him . Begging his father to understand that what he did , in belting Mr. Grebbs , was in self-defense Hal 's father acts as if he 's been there , at the theater , and saw the whole incident with his son Hal acting like a street thug instead of of a young man being grabbed and pushed without provocation . Not excusing what Hal did , in laying out Mr. Grebbs , he in fact was willing to admit his hooligan behavior but he wanted both Mr. Grebbs and his dad to at least treat him with an iota of consideration ; Gebbs in the fact that he provoked Hal and Mr. Ditmas in not even bothering to hear him out ! Feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone , but his mom , to really turn too Hal slowly loses it only to later have both Sgt. Shipley and Mr. Grabbs agree to drop the assault charge . You would think that by now Hal 's has finally learned his lesson but the real lesson , more then a stretch behind bars , that Hal 's so desperately needed was a lesson that his father totally ignored ! Being there when his son needed him most and in that Mr. Ditmar failed with flying colors . Things do in fact straighten out for everyone in the movie only after Mr. Grebbs gets belted , ending up with a butte of a shiner , again by Hal who , going back to Grebbs theater , tries to get him to phone his dad and tell him that Hal was only defending himself when he first , not the second time around , clobbered him . In the end Hal learned a real lesson in getting along with people an not letting his problems become other peoples problems . But most of all Hal 's father Mr. Ditmar learned the most valuable lesson of all in how to understand his frustrated and alienated son and act like a father toward him instead of a combination jail-keeper and a sugar daddy . Like the song says "" All you need s Love "" to get things on the right track and it was both love and understanding for his son Hal that Mr. Ditmar , until the very end of the movie , lacked the most off .

Back in those days many parents caught up with making big bucks and living high on the hog forget that their children , especially teen-agers , needed a lot more then a car and and hefty allowance in order to feel part of the family . They also needed love and attention , to their growing up problems , which is what 16 year-old Hal Ditmar , James MacArthur never got from his successful movie producer dad Mr.Tom Ditmar , James Daly . Never really connecting with his dad Hal grows more and more distant from both him and his caring mom Helen Ditmar , Kim Hunter , as well as from society . After his dad put Hal down about him wanting to borrow his car , a late model luxury sedan , he and his friend Jerry , Jeffery Silver , drive in Hal 's beat up and barley operational 1930 's jalopy to the local treater to catch the latest western flick . Feeling like striking out at the world Hal acts like a real first-class jerk sticking his smelly feet almost into the faces of a couple , Eddie Ryder & Jean Corbett , sitting in front of him and Jerry trying to watch the movie . This leads Hal , as well as his friend Jerry , to not only be kicked out of the theater but with him belting the theater manager Mr. Grebbs , Whit Bissell . It turned out that at least Hal was willing to leave the theater , without even getting his money back , but when Grebbs tries to grab him Hal wheeled around and belted him right in the kisser . Hal now in real hot water , he 's charged with assault and battery , put 's on his "" James Dean "" act , at the local police station , making like he 's either too cool or just plain stupid to realize what he 's done ; almost knocked Mr. Grebbs teeth out . It 's when Sgt.Shipley , James Gergory , tells Hal that his dad is coming to pick him up when he finally sobers up to the fact of what he 's done . The rest of the film has Hal try to straighten himself out but is unable to do that because the low esteem that his <replaced> has of him . Begging his father to understand that what he did , in belting Mr. Grebbs , was in self-defense Hal 's father acts as if he 's been there , at the theater , and saw the whole incident with his son Hal acting like a street thug instead of of a young man being grabbed and pushed without provocation . Not excusing what Hal did , in laying out Mr. Grebbs , he in fact was willing to admit his hooligan behavior but he wanted both Mr. Grebbs and his dad to at least treat him with an iota of consideration ; Gebbs in the fact that he provoked Hal and Mr. Ditmas in not even bothering to hear him out ! Feeling like a wanted criminal without anyone , but his mom , to really turn too Hal slowly loses it only to later have both Sgt. Shipley and Mr. Grabbs agree to drop the assault charge . You would think that by now Hal 's has finally learned his lesson but the real lesson , more then a stretch behind bars , that Hal 's so desperately needed was a lesson that his father totally ignored ! Being there when his son needed him most and in that Mr. Ditmar failed with flying colors . Things do in fact straighten out for everyone in the movie only after Mr. Grebbs gets belted , ending up with a butte of a shiner , again by Hal who , going back to Grebbs theater , tries to get him to phone his dad and tell him that Hal was only defending himself when he first , not the second time around , clobbered him . In the end Hal learned a real lesson in getting along with people an not letting his problems become other peoples problems .

262,"This is a simple episode ad so far after watching all of the Season 11 episodes ( with the exception of the Imaginationland trilogy ) this is the one that made laugh the most , definitely is my favourite so far of Season 11 . So basically Cartman sees at a toy store a kid who has the Tourette 's syndrome and a new idea comes to Cartman . You can imagine , now Cartman has Tourette 's syndrome and is great since Kyle once he knows about this is like "" he 's faking "" . Cartman is certainly on fire , saying whatever he wants to the teachers , to the principal , to anybody . On the other hand we have Kyle who now is the intolerant one , basically for saying that Cartman was faking he was taken to meet children with Tourette 's syndrome just to let him see that Tourette 's syndrome is for real and is great since Kyle is like "" well maybe someone is faking to have Tourette 's for fun "" , in short Kyle could not explain that Cartman was faking . Probably my favourite scene of this episode is when Cartman is with Kyle 's family but right after this scene another kid fins that Cartman is simply faking , the kid with Tourette 's who was at the toy store , Cartman basically said to that kid this : "" is n't having Tourette 's awesome "" . But to be saying whatever he wants and be for everybody a brave boy is sort of just the beginning for Cartman , his master plan : going on National TV to say anything he wants ( "" people will call it brilliant TV , they 'll probably give me an Emmy "" - fantastic , in this episode the word "" s *** "" is used 26 times and certainly that 's not all . South Park won an Emmy like a month or so before this episode aired ) . But here there 's a twist , Cartman basically removed all the bricks of the wall , he says now everything without thinking so we hear from Cartman that he wet his bed last night , now is not fun for Cartman and he is like "" I ca n't control what I say "" and certainly the person who was with him is like "" well of course you ca n't control what you say , you have Tourette 's "" so Cartman is like "" my Tourette 's has gotten worse , before I just blurted out cool stuff about Jews being lame and stuff but now it 's gotten really bad "" . There is also stuff about Chris Hansen and To Catch a Predator , actually what happened with a pervert here happens with a lot more perverts , Kyle and Thomas were behind that to stop Cartman , Kyle ends being Cartman 's saviour !

For viewers less familiar with the symptoms of this neurological disorder , the misleading take away message could n't have been clearer unless you curse , you do n't have TS . Despite our pre-airing trepidations , we do concede that the episode was surprisingly well - researched .

The scripted input from parents , a neurologist , peers and the therapy session with the "" TS children 's support group "" all served as a clever device for providing these facts to the public . "" No doubt this South Park episode did generate increased national awareness about TS . Nevertheless , we are very concerned that school children with TS will be mocked and even bullied by insensitive peers who may have seen the program , "" said Judit Ungar , TSA President . "" We realize that for over a decade the writers ' satirical parodies have spared no group be they celebrities , the disabled or political figures .

263,"I recently had the idea to make a short film featuring a man who is hit by a car and wakes up thinking that he himself is Chuck Norris . This meant that I would have to do extensive Chuck research , and find out as much as I could about the man . I later find out that he is not in fact a man , but an angel sent from heaven . With a face like that , who could ever doubt it ? I have watched more Chuck Norris movies in the last four months than any one person should . I am proud to say that Bells of Innocence ranks pretty close to the top of the all time worst list . I spent most of the film wondering if I could return my copy to the local Wal-Mart without the receipt , which I had been biting down on to keep myself from swallowing my own tongue . The biggest reason why I chose to purchase this film was that it not only had Chuck in it , but his son Mike . I was anxious to see if Mike was a chip off the old ca n't - act-his-way-out-of-a-wet-paper-bag block . I came to the conclusion a long while ago ; the Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in cinematic history for one simple reason . The only character he ever plays is himself , Chuck Norris . No matter what movie , no matter what situation , he is always Chuck Norris . The one thing that he holds over his son is that he is consistent . Mike does n't seem to understand how human emotions work . In the scene where he is talking to the little girl about his dead daughter , he seems to be extremely happy ! Maybe this is because he actually pushed his daughter out into traffic , as depicted in one of the oddest flashbacks of all time . His actions confused me throughout the film , making it very hard for me to focus on what little plot there was . The other two lead actors were just as painful to watch as the son of Norris . The guy , who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke , was simply one of the most annoying characters that has ever graced the Direct-to-Video screen . The only thing I remember him being in other than this movie , was an episode of Walker Texas Ranger , in which he plays an equally annoying character . Maybe Chuck owes this guy something . The other guy , which is the only name I can think of because he was so forgettable , was your average Christian fanatic . I do n't have anything against Christians , in fact I am one , but this guy was just too much for me .

266,"The Concorde ... Airport '79 starts in Washington where a man named Carl Parker ( Macon ( McCalman ) contacts high profile TV news reporter Maggie Whelan ( Susan Blakely ) in order to hand secret documents over that prove his boss Kevin Harriosn ( Robert Wagner ) owner & president of Harrison Industries that develop weapons for the military has been illegally selling said weapons to foreign countries . However Maggie sees Carl assassinated & she barely escapes with her life , Maggie is to catch the Concorde to Moscow via Paris the next morning & intends to blow the whistle on Harrison who also happens to be her boyfriend which would ruin him . Determined to save himself he reprogrammes his hi-tech ' Buzzard ' homing missile to intercept & destroy the Concorde during a test run killing all those on-board & destroying the documented evidence ... Renamed Airport '80 - The Concorde for it 's cinema & initial home video releases because it was released here in , well , 1980 rather than 1979 this last entry in the Airport franchise was directed by David Lowell Rich & is a notoriously bad film that was apparently laughed at during press & test screenings prompting Universal to promote the film as an action comedy . The first thing to say is that The Concorde ... Airport '79 is a really silly & downright daft film but on a purely entertainment basis I can think of a lot worse films to spend 108 minutes watching , I really can . I quite liked the absurd plot about a wealthy industrialist wanting to kill his girlfriend TV reporter before she can expose him as an illegal arms dealer but this guy does n't do subtle & decides the best way to do it is to blow Concorde up with his own guided missile & then gets a Fench fighter pilot to try & shoot it down before finally sabotaging it so really there 's three mini disaster flicks in one here as each time super pilot Joe Patroni manages to save the day . You know Joe Patroni played by George Kennedy appears in all four Airport films & goes from mechanic in the first to Concorde pilot extrodinaire in this , also I reckon he 's a bit of a jinx since in the space of nine years he has been involved with four major aviation disasters . I think the real reason why the Airport series stopped here was because Patroni retired after this & the jinx was lifted . Some of the things that happen here are just silly , Patroni does barrel rolls , flies upside-down & out manoeuvre 's a guided missile in a huge Concorde not to mention he crash lands it & fires flare guns out of his window to destroy the missile all while keeping a calm head . This guy is good , very good . Then there 's the character 's , there 's a Saxophone playing black dude who smokes weed in the toilets , an old woman with a bladder problem & a team of Russian gymnasts with bad accents . Also , despite being almost shot down with a missile & then attacked by a Jet fighter the passengers of Concorde do n't seem that bothered & happily get back aboard the following day , I do n't know about you but after that I would probably find a safer way to travel & why do the police or authorities not question anyone ? Why is the Concorde captain Patroni allowed to just go off & sleep with a French prostitute ? The Concorde ... Airport '79 certainly is n't boring & is full of memorable moments & I was entertained in a way although it 's far from a good film & modern audiences may not have the patience with it , hell I liked it for what it was in a daft way but it 's no sort of classic . Even though Concorde no longer flies it 's still quite a cool looking air-plane & there 's plenty of footage of it here , the one used in The Concorde ... Airport '79 was the seventh one built . This Concorde was also the same aircraft which crashed after a tire bust caused a fuel tank to rupture and the leaking fuel catch fire on July 25th 2000 , while taking off in Paris sadly resulting in the death of 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground . When this aired on TV in the US in 1982 almost twenty minutes of new footage was included with most if not all of it being newly shot over two years after the original production had finished . I know the effects here take a bashing from most but I do n't reckon they are too bad , when you consider this was made in the late 70 's I think they come across quite well . The camera moves during effects shots , real footage of real planes is used rather than toy models which in my opinion would have looked a lot worse & I could certainly see what the makers were trying to do with limited funds & limited technology . In a strange way they are quite impressive actually without ever looking that good if you know what I mean . Probably the most action packed of all the Airport films there 's missiles , exploding planes , daring crash landings , assassinations & a guy named Robert Palmer ( no , not the singer ) giving head a woman in a jacuzzi . The IMDb says this had a budget of about $ 14,000,000 which is actually more than I thought , maybe those special effects are n't so impressive after all . Shot in Utah , Washington , Los Angeles & France . The acting is n't great here , people do n't look worried enough that they are about to die . Goerge Kennedy gets some bad one-liners while Robert Wagner plays the bad guy . The Concorde ... Airport '79 is fun for bad film enthusiasts everywhere & to be brutally honest I rather watch this entertaining mess of a film than some two hour Oscar nominated bore . ","The Concorde ...

273,"( Some Spoilers ) PRC quickie that has J. Carrol Naish playing Dr. Igor Markoff who 's not really Dr. Karkoff but an impostor who took over his identity back in Europe . The real Dr. Karkoff had a affair with Dr.Markoff 's wife that lead to him to murder the real Dr.Markoff and then having his wife Lenore infected with acromegaly that made her look like the "" Elephant Man 's "" sister . This was done so that no one would ever want to look at her and he could keep Lenore all to himself ; but the disturbed Lenore later got even with her insane husband by killing herself . This nut , the fake Dr. Markoff , then spots Patricia Lawrence , Wanda McKay , one evening at the theater where her father Tony Lawernce , Ralph Morgan , a world famous pianist is giving a concert . Enchanted by the lovely Patricia who 's a dead ringer for his dead wife Lenore Dr. Markoff becomes obsessed with her and goes to extreme lengths to marry her even though she 's want 's nothing to do with him . After getting ridicules in his efforts to get Patricia to fall in love with him , by sending her flowers with syrupy love notes attached to then as much as five times a day , Tony goes to see the crazed Dr. Mankoff to tell him to stop annoying his daughter . It 's then that Tony ends up getting knocked out by the good doctor who has him injected with a dose of acromegaly that turns him into a somewhat unsightly fellow . With his hands and body swelling up and not being able to play his beloved piano Tony is told by his Doctor Dr. Adams , Sam Flint , that the only one who can cure him of that dreadful disease is non other then Dr. Markoff ! the person who gave it to him . The movie has the usual sub-plots with Dr. Markoff 's assistant Maxine , Tala Birell , who 's also in love with him jealous of the phony doctor making a play for Patricia . There 's also Dr. Markoff 's hulking butler Glenn Strange who , like his pet gorilla , is just a big clumsy oaf who ca n't even subdue Maxine who 's less the half the size . Strange ends up getting bopped on the head and knocked out cold by Patricia 's boyfriend Bobby Blake , Terry Frost . As for the Gorilla he turns out to be but a big hairy wimp when he also tries to do in Maxine and is chased away , and locks himself back up in his cage , by the pet dog Ace . Dr. Markoff in his desperation to get Patricia to marry him promises her to cure her dad only to have her father break out of his chains and in the ensuing struggle with him ends up shooting Markoff dead with his own gun . There is a happy ending to this whole mess with Maxine , who knew as much about Markoff 's cure for acromegaly as he did , injecting Tony with a secret serum that made him as good as new .

The logistics are overwhelming , particularly given the considerations of wartime communication , security and transportation in the 1940 's . As an example -- my colleague 's father was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract with the federal government for the Manhattan Project .

It is not possible . A person , who love and care about another dying one , would do everything to make the life of this one better . He would not have a free minute to ponder , to be alone with oneself , and if he finds a few minutes a month for that , he would run away from the places where he has usually to be . Another thing . The male author devoted this film to Andrey Tarkovsky . We see he learned many Tarkovsky 's visual effects . But in Sokurov 's film they are only effects , they do not support any senses or mood . Someone has compared this film with "" Mirror "" ( "" Zerkalo "" ) . There is nothing common except these visual effects . "" Mirror "" is a great film and this one is just poor imitation . ",,

We are at once intrigued and repulsed by her actions ... and never given more information than is necessary .

281,"SPOILERS , BEWARE !!! Flashdance is a fair movie , in my opinion . Some things do confuse me about it ( e.g. Jeanie asks Alex how long it took for her to get so good at dancing ; Alex replies "" About 25 years , "" is n't Alex supposed to be 18 ? ) and some things do fascinate me about it ( I LOVED the spins ! ) . Overall , though , it intrigued me . When this movie was made , I was n't even born . I did n't really experience the eighties ( I was born in ' 85 ) and I have to wonder : sometimes Alex would just run in place a bit , or throw herself all over , not really dancing , just banging in to things , tossing her head back , and waving her arms-was this considered "" dancing "" back then ? If it was , I 'm not sure I could 've standed it . The spins , the flip , the fluid movements were great , but some of it-my neighbor 's toddler could 've done better ! Also , if Alex is a welder during the day , would n't she be tired after a hard day 's work ? When she does n't go to work for nearly a week , would n't she be laid off ? Living in a warehouse-I can almost see it , but not quite . It does n't seem right that she 's a welder , owns a warehouse house , AND is trying to get into ballet . None of it really makes sense . I should n't be too judgemental considering my own background , but please . Maybe Jennifer Beals is too feminine for me to see her as a welder , I do n't know . But either way , they could 've picked a better actress . The actors were fine . I even liked the romance . You make your own decision .

Overall . . Marvellous piece of work by Aparna Sen , Konkona Sen and Shabana Azmi ... ",,

288,"THE KITE RUNNER is one of those modern epics that one is occasionally graced with . Spanning two continents , multiple family generations , and many decades , this film touches on a myriad of items including friendship , love , loss , and , ultimately , redemption . It 's prime mover is young Amir ( Zekeria Ebrahimi ) , a native Afghan boy who often plays with the hired help ; mainly young Hassan ( Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada ) , a Hazara boy who 's family is supposedly inferior to the ruling Afghans . But the two form a bond of friendship based on education ( Amir teaches Hassan to read ) , closeness in Amir 's house , and , of course , kite flying . But bad times are on the way for the city of Kabul . The communists are invading and Amir and Hassan have separated due to an impossibly brutal act of prejudice by an Afghan boy against Hassan . The two may never see each other again . Amir 's father races to get himself and his son out of Afghanistan , eventually finding their way to America . Here the two set up a gas station and live hand to mouth by selling at niche markets . And as Amir 's father gradually becomes ill , a new revelation will strike to the heart of Amir ; one that he can not ignore and requires his return to his beloved Kabul . A study of friendship , war , and reconciliation , The Kite Runner is truly a fantastic piece of cinema . The story is never inappropriately spoken in English whenever we 're in a foreign country , and only broken English whenever we 're in America . This was refreshing and lent itself to a sense of realism . The acting was on-par with the best you 'll see , too . Particular note must be made of Homayoun Ershadi who plays Baba , Amir 's ailing father and strong patriarch . Also lead Khalid Abdalla as the older Amir is played well , especially when returning to Kabul to find it in ruin ; quite the contrast from when he 'd left . The cinematography of Afghanistan during Amir 's escape and ultimate return are nothing short of breathtaking , with snow-capped peaks that will cause your mouth to slacken ( I 'm not sure exactly which mountain range they used in the film , but wherever it was I want to go there and film it myself ! ) But it is n't the cinematography nor the acting of one or two people that makes this film a success . It is a simple story told very well that makes it worth any movie watchers ' while . Highly recommended . ","THE KITE RUNNER is one of those modern epics that one is occasionally graced with .

But Nevsky replies : "" Die in your homeland but do n't leave it "" . He intents to fish , build ships and trade . But he warns of a more dangerous enemy : Nearer , meaner and no possibility to buy oneself out : Germany . Their objective is Novgorod .

Rich merchants want to purchase their liberty ( always a place for some anti-capitalist p. r. ) , but the "" common people "" are ready to fight . They want Alexander as their leader . Pskov is burned to the ground . The teutonic knights feel invincible and have just a smug smile for the russian women who witness helplessly how their fathers and sons are butchered . Babies are thrown in the fire while high dignitaries of the church look on and remain idle . In Novgorod : Olga Danilovna has two admirers : rich and staid Gavrilo and tall and jolly Vasili . She promises to marry the most valiant . Vasili calls on Alexander Nevsky in Perejaslav . The prince decides not to wait for the attack but to strike at once . Even women put on a chain armor ...

Open your eyes and watch the most impressive battle scenes ever filmed . It 's not just the multitude of extras ( Who were , I think , pressed in this patriotic exercise ) , but Eisenstein 's masterful management of such a large number of individuals : he displaces divisions like pieces on a chess board and nearly every shot resembles the composition of a painting by Rembrandt or Rubens ( Including horses in phantastic outfits ) . Russia in winter looks intimidating in itself , but Eisenstein 's visual imagination is hors concours . Heaps of corpses are plunged in cosmic light under an endless horizon . At nightfall , Olga and other women search with torches for survivors . A devoted falcon sits on his master 's dead body while a crow waits for the right moment to pick out the eyes of the deceased . Eisenstein 's direction and Prokofiev 's score make ALEXANDER NEVSKY the "" Rolls Royce "" among propaganda films . Nevsky is , of course Stalin 's alter ego , and the russians are tall , good-looking , heroic , and they have a perfect hairdo .

The only reason i feel comfortable writing this is because i 'm sure no one will ever get around to reading it . I mean , really , who is going to look up this movie these days ? I just discovered that i have not yet used up the ten line minimum for the amount of length i most take up in a review . i had no idea there was such a minimum length , but there i go , like a student trying to fill up a page in a journal , my ten lines . thank you very much .

296,"PREY Aspect ratio : 1.37:1 Sound format : Mono A lesbian couple ( Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan ) living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man ( Barry Stokes ) who turns out to be a flesh-eating alien , the vanguard of a massive invasion ... Despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing , Norman J. Warren 's follow-up to SATAN 'S SLAVE ( 1976 ) amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts , thanks to a surprisingly complex script by Max Cuff ( apparently , his only writing credit ) : Faulkner and Annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the English countryside ( rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by Derek V. Browne 's eye-catching cinematography ) , though Annan 's discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one ( or both ) of these doe-eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed , which may explain the absence of their respective families , some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and ' left ' under mysterious circumstances . Stokes ' unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray , partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because Annan is attracted to him , creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence . There 's an extraordinary , multi-layered sequence in which Faulkner attempts to 'em asculate ' their clueless visitor by dressing him in women 's clothing , though Stokes ' alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery . In the early scenes , at least , the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity , but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd-pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude , culminating in an explosion of horror when Annan allows herself to be ravished by Stokes following a violent argument with Faulkner . The closing sequences are ( quite literally ) gut-wrenching , especially Annan 's final scene , which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in 1977 and never fully restored ( what remains is still pretty vivid , so brace yourselves ! ) . Excellent performances by the three leads , bolstered by Warren 's unobtrusive direction , which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations , thereby compensating for the film 's budgetary shortcomings .

297,"Got the chance to see this at a friend 's house today , and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget . Not that this ever bothered me anyway , since I love low budget sci-fi like Dr Who , Blake 's 7 and Dark Star . Hell , even Outland was n't a big budget affair , so whilst money helps , it takes more than throwing cash at things to make them good . The story is straightforward at first , with a group of mercenaries paid to escort a prisoner through space . Their ship is attacked and they are forced to land on the nearest planet . They then discover the prisoner has made it too , he 's a stone cold nut case and that 's only the start of their problems . The effects , except for the gunfights , are minimalistic and add to the film without overwhelming it . Computer effects look a bit dodgy at times , but serve their purpose well and add to the story , lending a futuristic feel to the proceedings . Films like I , Robot could have benefited from this approach instead of being largely style over substance and substituting special effects for a plot , like all too many of Hollywood 's offerings . Whilst none of the actors get Oscar material , it 's tightly scripted and shot and at an hour and ten minutes does n't outstay its welcome . The characters do n't get fleshed out much , but then they did n't in Predator either , which it resembles in feel . Big man Mike Mitchell is a good stand in for Arnie and is a good combination of brains and brawn . Some people may be annoyed at the lack of explanation towards the end , but I like it . Unlike a lot of films and shows which leave things unexplained , it is not so obscure that you ca n't get a handle on it at all , and I 'd like to see a sequel where the nature of the aliens is explored further . A cracking little film from an enterprising team , done on the cheap but a fun way to pass an hour . If this is what they can do on a shoestring I 'd like to see what they would do with a bit more cash , and hope the film industry and the talentless armchair critics do n't knock all the creativity out of them first .

301,"This film was okay , but like most TV series it would of been better if it just made for television . The best and most loved characters only had five minute roles , whilst the three mediocre characters were all the way through the film . Unlike most British movies that are based on television series , this film does kick off and it seems to be on to a winner , but the pace suddenly stops when the three mediocre characters are in the real world waiting to capture the three comedians . The film then does n't go anywhere when Hillary in a room with the captured Steve , Lipp masquerading as Steve , and Geoff somehow writing himself in to the Medieval times . Which made me think ' hang on ? How come he does n't need a key to enter in to that world unlike the Royston Vasey characters ? The medieval scene was okay but Monty Python did it a lot better and of course funnier , with cameos from Peter Kay and Simon Pegg , both did n't say anything funny , Kay had a line and Pegg just sat up on wall looking bored . What also grated me was that they seem to forget what happened in the previous episodes such as Hillary escaped to the Caribbean in the television in series 2 , but in the film he 's escaped from prison , and also Lipp is a paedophile vampire which was n't mentioned at all in the movie , which was also quite disturbing when he 's left alone looking after the children . There were lots of plot holes and unexplained situations such as how did Geoff and the Dark One escape from the Medieval times back in to Royston Vasey ? Like Series 3 it started of good but as the film progressed , it slowly went downhill and had a very weak predictable ending . They would of been better off doing what Monty Python did and remade all their best and classic sketches from Series 1-3 and the Christmas special , and turned that in to a film which would of re-introduced the characters to a whole new audience , who ca n't be asked to watch the series or to tight to buy the DVDs . Best advice is save your money and wait till it 's on television .... . Where it belongs . ","This film was okay , but like most TV series it would of been better if it just made for television .

309,"I was very happy and at the same time quite surprised by other positive comments written by non-Koreans below . This movie is amazingly heartshaking , and shows very ' sad but warm ' view toward life which is typical to Korean people . I thought other foreigners would not understand this delicate feeling and under-rate this quiet film as a boring one , but I was wrong . The attraction of this film might be hard to avoid to foreigners , too . ( Even without subtitle ... ) I would like to mention some points others have missed . Of course , this film depicts love between a man and a woman . However , the very theme is way beyond that . Actually , it is about time , value of remembrance , and death . In this film , the focus is not on the ' love affair ' between two people . As some pointed out , they do not kiss , they do not hug each other , even without holding hands . So love itself is not completed ( whether positively or negatively ) in the film . Rather , what haunts Jungwon ( a leading actor ) is his impending death . He 's running out of time , he ca n't hold it , leaving a few behind including his father and of course , Darim ( a metermaid ) . So the problem is how he can face the death and leave something valuable in his short life , not how he can make love with Darim . This kind of theme sounds very familiar to us . There are lots of movies regarding patients with uncurable disease such as ' Love Story ' . However , what makes this film outstanding is the way Jungwon deals his death . He is a loser , but tried to do his best while he 's alive , IN A SILENT WAY . He does not tell anybody around him about his death . He hides something in his mind but without rage , hate , vengeance . He just tried to do best while he was alive . This limited communication and obedience to fate is the typical mindset of Koreans and the point most Western people do n't understand or at best , misunderstand . This theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this film ( surprisingly , his debut ) . Some say he 's much influenced by Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro , who directed Tokyo Story . Indeed , I remember I read in some magazine that the director himself admitted he was influenced by Ozu . I 'm not that knowledged to analyze his style comparing to Ozu 's , but they have some in common and some not . Low angle and static camera , especially remind us Ozu 's style . But , in terms of theme again , this Korean director seems to have somewhat warmer and hopeful vision . It is expressed concisely with Jungwon 's last photograph . Very well done and really heartbreaking scene , I think . Actually , the director first had the idea of this film when he participated the funeral of a very famous Korean folk singer who died young of mysterious suicide . They say he saw the photograph of the singer at the funeral and thought of a film on death and remembrance . ( And possibly hope for the remnants , I think ... ) I highly recommend this film to anybody who has deep interest in film art as well as Korean culture . This film , in my opinion , can be rivaled with other movies like Tokyo story , and a sort of American Beauty . It is that great if without language barrier .

310,"I wish it were "" Last Dumb Thriller "" . But thrillers are like that . They are like children : numerous , illogical , and often annoying . They want so desperately to be taken seriously but what is there to take seriously about a child 's behaviour or a thriller 's plot ? Having seen this particular child - I mean ... thriller - I understand why reviewers refer to it as "" a hitchcockian thriller "" ; they might as well have called it "" idiotic "" for that 's what "" hitchcockian "" means in the movie dictionary ( look it up , if you do n't believe me ) . Even the soundtrack is old-school Hollywood which is a mistake : it does n't fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony . Besides , how dare they steal De Palma 's idea of stealing from Hitchcock ?! The story is absurd . Scheider 's wife is killed , and her killers are never an issue . Instead , first his former employers follow him around , and later decide to kill him . Why do they decide to kill him ? No explanation . Perhaps because the FBI is a dark , dark organization ( "" X-Files "" ) which is very trigger-happy about knocking off its former employees for pension-funds reasons . Or perhaps because it 's fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie ; everyone seems to be after him . And while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major conspiracy , in reality the killer is ... Janet Margolin ! Yes , the woman occupying Scheider 's living quarters ; the one that briefly hinted she was "" depraved "" . Why does she go after Scheider at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid - and followed by his own ex-employers - and not a few years earlier or few years after the wife 's murder ? A pure hitchcockian ( look it up again in the dictionary , in case you forgot what it means ) coincidence . And how about that brilliant motive of hers ... ! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a fresh-off-the-boat 15 year-old virgin in NY , and then syphilisized by a bunch of horny Jewish men , one of whom - tah-dah ! - is Scheider 's grandfather . As a result , Margolin has been playing a hooker in her spare time ( among other things ) in order to kill off all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilisized her once-virginal grandmother . How hitchcockian ( look it up ) is that ? The finale then shamelessly rips off the Mount Rushmore scene from "" North By Northwest "" , except that the love-interest is a killer and she does n't get saved . The movie also offers some dubious/off-kilter dialog and some not-so great acting . Check out the silly and obvious way in which Napier follows Scheider at the cemetery . Let 's also not forget the moronic plot-device of Napier reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very suspiciously - but it was n't a gun ! How brilliant ! Napier in the tower : now , there 's another string of illogical behavioural patterns . J. Demme was , is , and always will be a director without style , without flair , and the man who directed "" Philadelphia "" . Let 's give him another Oscar !

Perhaps because the FBI is a dark , dark organization ( "" X-Files "" ) which is very trigger-happy about knocking off its former employees for pension-funds reasons . Or perhaps because it 's fashionable to want to kill Scheider in this movie ; everyone seems to be after him . And while the poor unsuspecting viewer is trying to figure out the mystery by logically assuming that there is a major conspiracy , in reality the killer is ... Janet Margolin ! Yes , the woman occupying Scheider 's living quarters ; the one that briefly hinted she was "" depraved "" . Why does she go after Scheider at precisely a time when his wife was murdered and he is feeling paranoid - and followed by his own ex-employers - and not a few years earlier or few years after the wife 's murder ? A pure hitchcockian ( look it up again in the dictionary , in case you forgot what it means ) coincidence . And how about that brilliant motive of hers ... ! Her grandmother was forced into prostitution when she was a fresh-off-the-boat 15 year-old virgin in NY , and then syphilisized by a bunch of horny Jewish men , one of whom - tah-dah ! - is Scheider 's <replaced> . As a result , Margolin has been playing a hooker in her spare time ( among other things ) in order to kill off all the descendants of the men who so cruelly syphilisized her once-virginal grandmother . How hitchcockian ( look it up ) is that ? The finale then shamelessly rips off the Mount Rushmore scene from "" North By Northwest "" , except that the love-interest is a killer and she does n't get saved . The movie also offers some dubious/off-kilter dialog and some not-so great acting . Check out the silly and obvious way in which Napier follows Scheider at the cemetery . Let 's also not forget the moronic plot-device of Napier reaching for his jacket and holding his hand very suspiciously - but it was n't a gun ! How brilliant ! Napier in the tower : now , there 's another string of illogical behavioural patterns . J. Demme was , is , and always will be a director without style , without flair , and the man who directed "" Philadelphia "" . Let 's give him another Oscar ! ","I wish it were "" Last Dumb Thriller "" . But thrillers are like that . They are like children : numerous , illogical , and often annoying . They want so desperately to be taken seriously but what is there to take seriously about a child 's behaviour or a thriller 's plot ? Having seen this particular child - I mean ... thriller - I understand why reviewers refer to it as "" a hitchcockian thriller "" ; they might as well have called it "" idiotic "" for that 's what "" hitchcockian "" means in the movie dictionary ( look it up , if you do n't believe me ) . Even the soundtrack is old-school Hollywood which is a mistake : it does n't fit a late 70s film and makes it look phony . Besides , how dare they steal De Palma 's idea of stealing from Hitchcock ?!

317,"I 'm currently slogging through Gibbon 's ' Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire , so I 've had all things Roman on my mind . I 'm not very far into it yet , maybe two hundred plus pages , but it is amazing just how many of these Roman emperors were killed . I believe I 've read through maybe 15 emperors so far and only Antonius , Trajan , and Hadrian have n't been killed or at least suspected of having been killed . I have also been fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of Rome . Not the least practitioner of these was Caligula . This brings me to reviewing this film . I 'm thinking of the film on a historical basis as far as I understand it from Gibbon 's explanation of Rome , as well as other research from some good web sites and some fiction novels dealings with the period . My point is I do not think that this film is what it is thought to be by many of it 's proponents . I do not think the depravity shown with the sex and horrendous violence of this film qualify it as accurate . The general ideas of the film seem accurate . Caligula is raised on an island , exiled with his family and in content fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad , suspicious and strange emperor Tiberius . He grows up paranoid and afraid and can never shake the cutesy nickname given him by his guards , Little Boots , this helps him grow up feeling abused and powerless . He is handed the empire after Tiberius dies , the senate hoping he will steer away from the informer squads which brought death by whim of the former delusionally paranoid tyrant , and lead Rome away from the madness that dictator had settled it into . Caligula begins as a decent if hands-off emperor , but gets sick , almost dies , and comes back from the brink of feverous death a true monster . His perversities with his sisters do begin here , if not before . He does have Macro killed and many others who were his originally supporters . The acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of Caligula as much as his new thinking of himself as a living God . Him seen talking to the statue of Jupiter as an equal doomed him . His violent mad excesses would have doomed him anyway , and three years seems to have been quite a decent run for the successors of Tiberius . Well the film basically sticks to these lines while it manages to be coherent , which is not common through it 's entirety , it does so while trying to shock the audience at all turns , in every single scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient Rome . The shocking scenes are what this film is built entirely upon and where it entirely fails . It is just too much to see successive rulers have man after man murdered , raped , tortured for no reason but fancy . The depictions of the violence are possibly , but not probably , accurate . Murder certainly was the order of the day in Imperial Rome , torture beforehand was rote . But the director 's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists , while the bystanders watch with nonchalance , I just do n't see it having gone down exactly like that . The death machine , the beheader , is certainly something like you 've never seen in movies , and something once seen you shall probably never forget , even as I , you wish you could . The wine drinking while the penis is roped off is the same , once you 've seen this shame it is yours forever . These things strike me the director 's and that porn magnate 's fantasies . They sprung from their sick imaginations and not from any proved record . The acting is pretty good . I actually think Mcdowell is the weakest link here . Mirren is always something to behold , and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful . The portrayals of Nerva and Tiberius are done very well by their respected actors . The film could have done so much better story telling , it is such a failure that way its just a whole other layer of what a shame this thing was . For example it could have given opinion on how and why Caligula went mad , or shown that he was mad , paranoid before his illness and that fever then broke the mental restraint he had possessed previously . It could have shown the weakness of Claudius and the miracle it was he survived Caligula . It could have these and many other things but it stuck to it 's sad nightmares . Finally about the sex . It is porn . It shows these sex acts being done all over the palaces by many people . Male on male , female on female , male on female . It is passionless , disgusting sex . Sex that if your point is to get off on it , I seriously doubt you could . Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been sex addicts , and orgies may have been common enough but the visions in this film seem to recall more a Greek time than a Roman . I do n't think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies right out in the open were common until the the strange , depraved reign of Elgabalus , and he was killed for it . This film should probably never be watched , if your curious about it , let it go . It is something , as I said earlier , if you do watch this you will unfortunately retain it 's sick visions in your minds eye for years to come . I do n't think its an accurate historical picture in particular , even if it is historical in whole .

But the director 's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists , while the bystanders watch with nonchalance , I just do n't see it having gone down exactly like that . The death machine , the beheader , is certainly something like you 've never seen in movies , and something once seen you shall probably never forget , even as I , you wish you could . The wine drinking while the penis is roped off is the same , once you 've seen this shame it is yours forever . These things strike me the director 's and that porn magnate 's fantasies . They sprung from their sick imaginations and not from any proved record . The acting is pretty good . I actually think Mcdowell is the weakest link here . Mirren is always something to behold , and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful . The portrayals of Nerva and Tiberius are done very well by their respected actors . The film could have done so much better story telling , it is such a failure that way its just a whole other layer of what a shame this thing was . For example it could have given opinion on how and why Caligula went mad , or shown that he was mad , paranoid before his illness and that fever then broke the mental restraint he had possessed previously . It could have shown the weakness of Claudius and the miracle it was he survived Caligula . It could have these and many other things but it stuck to it 's sad nightmares . Finally about the sex . It is porn . It shows these sex acts being done all over the palaces by many people . Male on male , female on female , male on female . It is passionless , disgusting sex . Sex that if your point is to get off on it , I seriously doubt you could . Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been sex addicts , and orgies may have been common enough but the visions in this film seem to recall more a Greek time than a Roman . I do n't think that kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgies right out in the open were common until the the strange , depraved reign of Elgabalus , and he was killed for it . This film should probably never be watched , if your curious about it , let it go . It is something , as I said earlier , if you do watch this you will unfortunately retain it 's sick visions in your minds eye for years to come . I do n't think its an accurate historical picture in particular , even if it is historical in whole . ","I 'm currently slogging through Gibbon 's ' Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire , so I 've had all things Roman on my mind . I 'm not very far into it yet , maybe two hundred plus pages , but it is amazing just how many of these Roman emperors were killed . I believe I 've read through maybe 15 emperors so far and only Antonius , Trajan , and Hadrian have n't been killed or at least suspected of having been killed . I have also been fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of Rome . Not the least practitioner of these was Caligula . This brings me to reviewing this film . I 'm thinking of the film on a historical basis as far as I understand it from Gibbon 's explanation of Rome , as well as other research from some good web sites and some fiction novels dealings with the period . My point is I do not think that this film is what it is thought to be by many of it 's proponents . I do not think the depravity shown with the sex and horrendous violence of this film qualify it as accurate . The general ideas of the film seem accurate . Caligula is raised on an island , exiled with his family and in content fear of being murdered by the increasingly mad , suspicious and strange emperor Tiberius . He grows up paranoid and afraid and can never shake the cutesy nickname given him by his guards , Little Boots , this helps him grow up feeling abused and powerless . He is handed the empire after Tiberius dies , the senate hoping he will steer away from the informer squads which brought death by whim of the former delusionally paranoid tyrant , and lead Rome away from the madness that dictator had settled it into . Caligula begins as a decent if hands-off emperor , but gets sick , almost dies , and comes back from the brink of feverous death a true monster . His perversities with his female sisters do begin here , if not before . He does have Macro killed and many others who were his originally supporters . The acts of madness seemed not to be the murders of Caligula as much as his new thinking of himself as a living God . Him seen talking to the statue of Jupiter as an equal doomed him . His violent mad excesses would have doomed him anyway , and three years seems to have been quite a decent run for the successors of Tiberius . Well the film basically sticks to these lines while it manages to be coherent , which is not common through it 's entirety , it does so while trying to shock the audience at all turns , in every single scene the film begs you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient Rome . The shocking scenes are what this film is built entirely upon and where it entirely fails . It is just too much to see successive rulers have man after man murdered , raped , tortured for no reason but fancy . The depictions of the violence are possibly , but not probably , accurate . Murder certainly was the order of the day in Imperial Rome , torture beforehand was rote . But the director 's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists , while the bystanders watch with nonchalance , I just do n't see it having gone down exactly like that .

He meets up with a gang which contains an arrogant boss , an obvious idiot , a fat boy who never speaks , and a woman who rotates between the three of them . The group which is called Satan 's Angels , wants Rod , the driver , as their personal driver . He says no but then says yes after the authorities make him a spy to check on them . They rob a weapon shop in a ridiculously plot-missing scene . The scene involves the woman walking into the store with her long hair in a bun and large circular glasses on .

328,"Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing united in one horror film ; that always sounds like a terrific plan . Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation , who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like "" The Flesh and the Fiends "" and "" From Beyond the Grave "" , pairing up in a mid-70 's satanic themed exploitation flick . How can this possibly go wrong ? Well , unfortunately , it can . To my deepest regret "" Land of the Minotaur "" can hardly even be called mediocre , and that in spite of the cast , the exotic setting , the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise . In a remote little area in Greece , more particularly near an archaeological site , multiple tourists vanish because Baron Peter Cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fire-breathing Minotaur statue . Cushing , who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before , owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in Greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns . That is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists . When three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area , Father Roch - the priest of a couple of towns before ) - decides to investigate . "" Land of the Minotaur "" is a boring and extremely slow-paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and does n't bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details . The titular Minotaur , for example , is an intriguing creature of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person , but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance . Instead , the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises . The only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of Donald Pleasance . His portrayal of rude , bossy and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always .

Genuinely funny moments are born from Brooke being surreptitiously bribed into having an abortion , murder by a crazed gunman and Mike treacherously betraying his best friend 's hopes and dreams , only to be told that he is a good friend . The series ' final minute minus an added-scene during the credits , which was probably added just in case a fourth season was to be produced was probably the greatest , blackest ending to a comedy series that I 've yet seen . Below is listed a very tentative list of my top five favourite "" Frontline "" episodes , but , make no mistake , every single half-hour is absolutely hilarious and hard-hitting satire . 1 ) "" The Siege "" ( Season 1 ) 2 ) "" Give 'em Enough Rope "" ( Season 2 ) 3 ) "" Addicted to Fame "" ( Season 3 ) 4 ) "" Basic Instincts "" ( Season 2 ) 5 ) "" Add Sex and Stir "" ( Season 1 ) ","Even a decade after "" Frontline "" aired on the ABC , near as I can tell , "" current affairs "" programmes are still using the same tricks over and over . Time after time , "" Today Tonight "" and "" A Current Affair "" are seen to be hiding behind the facade of journalistic professionalism , and yet they feed us nothing but tired stories about weight-loss and dodgy tradesmen , shameless network promotions and pointless celebrity puff-pieces . Having often been subjected to that entertainment-less void between ' The Simpsons ' at 6:00 PM and ' Sale of the Century ' ( or ' Temptation ' ) at 7:00 PM , I was all too aware of the little tricks that these shows would use to attract ratings . Fortunately , four rising comedians Rob Sitch , Jane Kennedy , Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner were also all too aware of all this , and they crafted their frustrations into one of the most wickedly-hilarious media satires you 'll ever see on television . The four entertainers had already met with comedic success , their previous most memorable television stint being on ' The Late Show , ' the brilliant Saturday night variety show which ran for two seasons from 1992-1993 , and also featured fellow comedians Mick Molloy , Tony Martin , Jason Stephens and Judith Lucy . "" Frontline "" boasts an ensemble of colourful characters , each with their own distinct and quirky personality . The current-affairs show is headed by nicely-groomed Mike Moore ( Rob Sitch ) , an ambitious , pretentious , dim-witted narcissist . Mike works under the delusion that the show is serving a vital role for society he is always adamant that they "" maintain their journalistic integrity "" and his executive producers have excelled into getting him to believe just that . Mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to the people ; occasionally he gets the inkling that he is being led along by the nose , but usually this thought is stamped out via appeals to his vanity or promises of a promotion . Brooke Vandenberg ( Jane Kennedy ) is the senior female reporter on the show . She is constantly concerned about her looks and public profile , and , if the rumours are to be believed , she has had a romantic liaison with just about every male celebrity in existence . Another equally amoral reporter , Marty Di Stasio , is portrayed by Tiriel Mora , who memorably played inept solicitor Dennis Denuto in the Australian comedy classic , ' The Castle . ' Emma Ward ( Alison Whyte ) is the Line Producer on the show , and the single shining beacon of morality on the "" Frontline "" set . Then there 's the highly-amusing weatherman , Geoffrey Salter ( Santo Cilauro ) , Mike 's best friend and confidant . Geoff makes a living out of always agreeing with Mike 's opinion , and of laughing uproariously at his jokes before admitting that he does n't get them . For each of the shows three seasons , we are treated to a different EP , Executive Producer . Brian Thompson ( Bruno Lawrence ) , who unfortunately passed away in 1995 , runs the programme during Season 1 . He has a decent set of morals , and is always civil to his female employees , and yet is more-than-willing to cast these aside in favour of high ratings . Sam Murphy ( Kevin J. Wilson ) arrives on set in Season 2 , a hard-nosed , smooth-talking producer who knows exactly how to string Mike along ; the last episode of the second season , when Mike finally gets the better of him , is a classic moment . Graeme "" Prowsey "" Prowse ( Steve Bisley ) , EP for the third season , is crude , unpleasant and unashamedly sexist . It 's , therefore , remarkable that you eventually come to like him . With its cast of distinctive , exaggerated characters , "" Frontline "" has a lot of fun satirising current-affairs programmes and their dubious methods for winning ratings . Many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply , often implementing many plot ideas from recent real-life situations , but this never really detracts from the show 's topicality ten years on . Celebrity cameos come in abundance , with some of the most memorable appearances including Pauline Hanson , Don Burke and Jon English .

339,"A while back I bought the Chinese box set of Fist of the North Star which came with all of Fist of the North Star , Fist of the North Star 2 , New Fist of the North Star , and the Fist of the North Star movie . While there is an American Version and a few European Versions , they end half way through Fist of the North Star which is about as far as the movie goes . The series is about the successor of an ancient martial art called Hokuto Shin Ken ( Fist of the North Star ) named Kenshiro , or Ken for short . There is only one successor each generation . It takes place in a post apocalyptic future where martial arts is the most powerful weapon . The two most powerful arts are Hokuto Shin Ken and Nanto Divine Ken as my version calls it . Nanto is really multiple styles but they are all the same since they allow a person to chop someone to pieces . There are six Nanto masters and each has their own star . Hokuto is an art that allows someone to damage/kill or heal someone by hitting a point on their body . Each art has their own constellation . Hokuto - Big Dipper , Nanto - Gemini . Kenshiro goes around saving the world from evil consisting of going after his two brothers and three of the Nanto masters and their armies . Each army captain has their own way of fighting which makes each episode different and the number of soldiers bloody . Also , Kenshiro is looking for his girlfriend Yuria who was stolen by the Nanto master Shin . Along the journey Kenshiro is joined by his brother Toki after rescuing him from his brother Rao who calls himself Kenou or Boxing King . He is also joined by two Nanto masters Rei , who is looking for his sister who was taken by Ken 's brother Jagi , and Shu . Both of them and Toki die along the way . Other characters that join Ken are two kids Rin and Batto who do n't do much . That 's about as much as I can say for story since its so long and full of details . The series is also divided into four parts . What makes this show great is the fighting . Ken normally goes up against a group of people that think they are tough and then get killed in one hit . Which is funny and badass , but makes for quick fights . Another great part is comedy/badassness . Ken hits someone , and they think its nothing . Ken says they are already dead . Then they die . Other parts are when he 'll hit them and tell them they have a few seconds to live . Then a counter will pop up . Or when he tells them they are not worthy of knowing his name . Then there is when he does a rapid fire kick or punch and goes wa da da da da da da etc . Eventually you might find yourself doing it with him . One great part was when a bad guy thought he knew Hokuto . He went up to Ken and hit him . Ken stood there said he was dead in a few seconds . The bad guy counted off then died . It is n't limited to Ken everyone else kills just as quick . There has never been a character as awesome as Ken and their probably never will . There are a few problems though . One is the repetitive nature . Some flashbacks mainly the one with Yuria being taken are played too much , and there are also too many recap episodes especially in part four of the series . In fact , the last episode is a recap of the whole thing . Another problem is the ending . The final battle with Rao was n't that impressive . Ken and Rao fought then talked , etc , until Rao came to some realization and kills himself instead of Ken killing him . But it is better than the American and European versions that just cut off halfway . Who would I recommend this for ? This is for older teenagers and adults who like action . Since the styles cause people to explode or get cut into pieces , the violence is very graphic and there is a lot of it , but they do n't show much blood because they usually make the death just a silhouette that still looks like the person but less colorful . This was probably done to avoid censorship . If you do n't like action rent the American Version . If you like action though , then I say go for the import since you can see all of the series , but they do not have the best English translation since it is subtitled by the Chinese . Note : My import came with everything I said at the beginning , some imported versions do not , but you still have to get an import to see all of the series and Fist of the North Star 2 . If you do n't think you can handle the subtitles for any reason then go get the American Version . Another note : In the version I got no subtitles were on the last disc for New Fist of the North Star ; although , New Fist of the North Star is n't very good to begin with . I give the show an 8/10 for its high amount of action , good story , and the awesomeness of Kenshiro . **** UPDATE **** Toei Animation released an English subtitled version .

340,"I thought this movie was really good . It ends up showing the viewers in the end that Leila should of kept what she had . Leila was sick of her husband Jim , who was more worried about work then her . He was so into his work that he forgot their anniversary . He was also very sloppy . She could n't take it anymore so she left to see if he would miss her . The movie shows that he misses her , he even tries to make up for the night he messed up .

It is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed . I would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape . It did not happen in or around Berlin as supposed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the Berlin Wall . The escape balloon was flown over the Iron Curtain which not only divided Germany but it divided the whole of Europe at that time . The balloon took off from Pössneck , 170 miles south-west of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) and flew 14 miles to Naila in Bavaria and freedom in West Germany . The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year . Whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema , it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from East Berlin , other parts of the GDR or other Soviet-controlled states .

He gives his prize egg to his little brother , Willie and heads off wishing to show more emotion and tenderness to his little acolyte . Well , Willie is n't having any of it , if Pete can be a soldier so can he . He heads to Memphis , showing his stubbornness and determination as he gets the better of several adults along the way . After finding the enlistment center in Memphis , he demands to see his brother , pulling a knife on a lieutenant and wounding him in the process . We are shown the devotion and love of a little brother ( Jonathan Furr ) . He delivers a impeccable performance as a stubborn strong-willed boy in the gentler times of yesteryear . The movie tries and mostly succeeds in showing how brothers can show devotion and the importance of family ties in one 's youth .

Especially the Alto Sax player that sometimes shows up ( he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the upper register ) , if anything , watch the show for him , I do . In summary , this show is n't even worth a full bag of kibble n ' bits . But it does have an audience , and appeals more to the younger "" mtv generation "" . If you do n't have cable and are up at 1:37 am , there really is n't much more to choose from and , surprise surprise , there is worse out there in that time frame . So , if you 're waiting for Poker After Dark to come on , 30 minutes of Last Call wont kill you during the wait . ",,

350,"Yes , you can look at Babette 's Feast as some sort of slap at Puritanical Christianity , but it is much more than that . The surface story of how a gifted Parisian cook flees Paris after one of its revolutions by the middle classes and finds herself cast ashore in Jutland in the north of Denmark is simply the grease that allows the deeper tale to develop . Babette is an artist , one of the small army of people who are driven from pillar to post over the centuries by fatuous politicians , vane , greedy and arrogant , who kill beauty for profit , something that politics always does , pace National Endowment for the Arts , which simply institutionalizes creativity for propaganda purposes . Babette is on her last legs as she arrives in the tiny village where two virginal sisters reside seeing over their diminishing flock of devotees to their late pastor father . They live on salt cod and black bread gruel . Babette shows these simple pious people that God is in pleasure and sensuality as well as behavioral and mental purity . She also shows them how that mental purity can lead to control freakishness , something we all know about in these days of the neo-authoritarians in government who would limit our personal freedoms because they are somehow a crime against the state , or as they would tell us , humanity . Babette cooks up a bang-up French dinner to celebrate the 100th birthday of the late reverend . The daughters and their flock think it is the devil come amongst them and vow not to notice the food or drink . It is at this point , in the preparing of the meal , payed for by Babette 's winnings in a French lottery , that I begin to tear-up . It is a poignance brought about in comparison to the daily vulgarity and mendacity that floods our consciousness from morning to night via the media and power-mongers manoeuvring to gain advantage over all of us out here in the dark . The simple sophistication of Babette 's art spits in the face of all the pretentiousness on display in our modern society , and it hurts to watch it played out so exquisitely in this splendid film . It is , along with Fanny och Alexander ( Bergman ) , my favorite film ever , yet I can only watch it once in awhile because , like a rare bottle of wine served with Blinis and fresh oysters , it is something that must not be over-done .

353,"In 1932 , Humphrey Bogart was a relative unknown -- an unproven actor who was starring in one of his first films . And , because he was an unknown , the movie they gave him was clearly a B-movie -- a quick film with relatively low expectations . After seeing it , I could see why it would still take Bogart many more years AND another film studio before he became a household name . While the film is n't terrible , it certainly is n't good -- making it more of a curiosity than anything else when seen today . Bogart is a pilot who has dreams of building his own aircraft engine company . However , when a vacuous rich playgirl comes his way , his dreams all seem to go on hold . As one of the characters in the film said , the combination of the two is like oil and water -- they just do n't mix . While Bogart is throwing away his promising career , his sister is going full speed on the Road to Skankville -- having met a sleazy guy who convinces her to sleep with rich guys so they can shake them down for tons of cash ! Bogey has no idea his sister IS N'T the actress she claims to be and does n't realize later that the rich woman he loves leaves him for the same guy whose mistress is .... Bogart 's SISTER !!! All this leads up to a finale that is reasonably enjoyable . However , what follows is one of the dumbest scenes I have watched in a very long time ! By now , the rich lady is not going to marry the guy sleeping with Bogey 's sister ( whew ! ) but because she 's now poor and no good for Bogart , she 's about to fly away and kill herself . Bogey finds out , chases the plane on foot , jumps on the plane as it 's taking off and crawls up the fuselage to take control of the plane and save her !!! This is so utterly silly and ridiculous , I found myself laughing out loud . Up until then , I might have scored it a 4 or 5 -- this sunk the movie to a 3 ( how one reviewer gave this an 8 is beyond me ) . The bottom line is that this was a talking and silly film . On top of that , it 's all wrong for Bogart , as the action hero at the end and the simpering lover are horrible matches for his persona that was so wonderfully created in the early 40s . Manly and solid better suits the man -- one of America 's great actors but clearly out of his element here . By the way , those who love Pre-Code films and their very adult sensibilities may want to see this one .

","The Foreigner is a straight-to-video Steven Seagal film that was originally intended to be released as a theatrical feature in March , 2003 , an intention which was reportedly reversed when Seagal 's prior film ( Half Past Dead ) tanked at the box office . According to some reports , the film had a lavish $ 20 million budget , including location shoots in Warsaw and Paris , and was completed as part of the studio 's obligation to a two-picture deal which was negotiated after the relative success of Exit Wounds seemed to indicate that Seagal still had a solid following . Despite the size of their investment , Sony Screen Gems probably made the right move in shelving this movie . It is nearly incomprehensible . What am I saying ? It IS incomprehensible . I do n't think I understood what was going on at all , except in the very broadest terms . Seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to deliver a mysterious package to another mysterious guy . Other mysterious guys try to stop him . Other highly mysterious guys try to kill the moderately mysterious guys who try to stop him . Other really , really mysterious guys do especially mysterious stuff , all of which which was in fact too mysterious for me to figure out . The intended recipient 's mysterious wife tries to intercept the package before it can be delivered to her husband . Because he is a self-proclaimed "" consummate professional "" who has been hired to deliver the package only into the hands of the husband , Seagal at first defies the wife , then later gets involved in protecting her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with unexplained agendas , as well as from her female husband . Many people have mysterious , cryptic conversations . Many people blow each other 's brains out . Some guys seem to die more than once , while in other scenes gunfights end without a clear view of the result , so the audience sees somebody die , but is not sure which one of the gunslingers is headed to boot hill . Allegiances shift often , adding further mystery . Or should I say confusion ? I do n't know who was on whose side , or what anybody really wanted , and the resolution was as unsatisfying as the exposition . At the end of the movie , I just sat there thinking , "" That 's the end ? What the ... ? "" I could n't even figure out the credits . IMDb says that Aussie actress Kate Fischer ( from "" Sirens "" ) was in this film , but I 'll be damned if I know where . Either she was left on the cutting room floor or she wisely opted out of the project . She could have found some activities more beneficial to her career , like having unnecessary surgery , ripping those pesky insert cards out of magazines , or taking some community college courses in animal husbandry . Seagal used to be a pretty fair hand-to-hand combatant , but the action scenes did n't manage to redeem this film at all . Seagal is in his 50 's now and is a very large man , so he is reduced to a mimimal level of physical exertion and even during that he is contained in a knee-length coat to hide his inchoate Brandoesque girth . He might even get a little winded removing the wrappers from candy bars , although that 's understandable if you estimate just how many of those he must have to eat to maintain his present girth . Steven Seagal seemed to be making a comeback with Exit Wounds , but if his last film was half past dead , this one must be pretty close to filling out the other half . ",,

356,"Gake no Ue no Ponyo is a beautifully animated film and a relief from the many heartless soulless CGI movies being made . The pastel and color pencil backgrounds were a surprise after Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi ( Spirited Away ) and Hauru no Ugoku Shiro ( Howl 's Moving Castle ) being so similar stylistically . The style worked well for the film and was done exceptionally well . The time and effort put in to animate this is greatly appreciated as it gives the characters so much more life , the detail and care it takes makes the movie turn out so much better . There are several great scenes throughout the movie that have lots of movement and action . The greatest to me being a scene were Ponyo 's sisters transform into massive wave like fish while she runs on top of them . The story is simple but fairly well written and played out . The plot stayed focused around character relationships and while it was n't played out as well as in Tonari no Totoro ( My Neighbor Totoro ) it is still great . I felt that each character had the an appropriate amount of screen time unlike Spirited Away which was so jammed with distinctive characters that it could have been stretched out into an entire series . ( The Radish Spirit . There was a another whole movie right there ! ) My only real problem with the movie was the end . The way its worded in the English version at least makes it seem like there 's going to be some great test given to Sōsuke which turns out to be just him promising Ponyos mother that he will love Ponyo . Though putting more thought into this leads me to think that translation may not be that accurate to the actual meaning in that the test is the promise and that deep down he really means it . The movie did seem to end abruptly though . Other than that the movie was great and I highly recommend it .

368,"From the perspective of the hectic , contemporary world in which we live , the so called ` good old days ' always seem so much more serene and innocent ; an idyllic era gone by of which we have only memories and shadows that linger on the silver screen , as with ` Christmas In Connecticut , ' a warm and endearing film directed by Peter Godfrey . Barbara Stanwyck stars as Elizabeth Lane , a popular ` Martha Stewart ' type magazine columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut , always with the latest recipe at the center of the story . One of her biggest fans is Alexander Yardley , played by Sidney Greenstreet , the publisher of the magazine for which she writes . Yardley has never visited her farm , and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse , Mary ( Joyce Compton ) , he decides to spend an old fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth , her husband and child and , as a special guest , a certain Mr. Jefferson Jones ( Dennis Morgan ) , a sailor just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed . Elizabeth of course can not refuse her boss , but there are problems ; not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of a high-rise in the city . It makes for a precarious situation for her as well as her editor , Dudley Beecham ( Robert Shayne ) , as the one thing Mr. Yardley demands from his employees is total honesty . What follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place , to share a Christmas Past where a warm hearth , good food and kindness prevail . Barbara Stanwyck absolutely sparkles as Elizabeth , with a smile and presence warmer than anything the grandest hearth could provide , and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm . Morgan also fares well as the somewhat naive sailor , whose trust in his fellow man is admirable . Even with the deceptions being played out around him , he 's the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet , and in the end it 's Elizabeth you really feel for . One of the true delights of this film , however , is Sidney Greenstreet . His Yardley has a gruff exterior , but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as Texas . It 's a straightforward , honest portrayal , and it 's a joy to watch him work ; the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him . The supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner ( John Sloan ) , the terrific Una O'Connor ( Norah ) , Frank Jenks ( Sinkewicz ) and Dick Elliott ( Judge Crothers ) . A feel-good movie that plays especially well during the Christmas Season ( though it would work any time of the year ) , ` Christmas In Connecticut ' is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously , is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be . It 's a true classic , and one you do not want to miss . I rate this one 10/10 .

370,"One of the Message Boards threads at IMDb had two women talking about Colin Firth , how they watched the movie only because of him . Obviously these were two young women ; but what struck me is how little this movie has been appreciated by audiences generally . The brilliant , and I mean brilliant , performances by Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange were hardly noticed , not only by audiences , but by the Academy and by most of the critics . I think I know why . First , the plot -- or actually just the setup -- is a kind of bastardization of Shakespeare 's King Lear with the dying , crazy patriarch and the three scheming daughters who will inherit . Their names even begin with the same letters , Regan , Goneril , and Cordelia -- Rose , Ginny , and Caroline . And I guess "" Larry "" ( Jason Robards ) works for "" Lear . "" The apparent idea envisioned by Jane Smiley in her Pulitzer Prize winning novel was to tell a Lear-like story from the point of view of the daughters , and to tell it a sort of late twentieth century realistic way not considered by the Bard . The problem is , in Smiley and Moorhouse 's story , the two older daughters are very human with strengths and weaknesses while the father is a most despicable character without much in the way of redeeming qualities . His only strength was his ability to make a financial success of the farm ; however , we can even discount that since his father and grandfather before him built the farm and he inherited it . The second problem -- and this is one I can not personally attest to , not having read Smiley 's novel -- is that the movie is only a limited and partial interpretation of that novel . Still , it is almost always the case that an excellent novel , especially a long and ambitious one with many psychological nuances , can not be faithfully transferred to the screen . The vision and audio demands of film drown out the subtleties of a narration while the time constraints do n't allow for the full development of character and motivation achieved by the novelist . Given five or six hours , perhaps Moorhouse could have made a movie more in keeping with Smiley 's novel . A third problem is one that is perhaps Moorhouse 's alone . She began her directing career with the very well done Aussie film Proof ( 1991 ) starring Russell Crowe . She follow it up with How to Make an American Quilt ( 1995 ) which celebrated women , especially women of a certain age . However it was a bit heavy-handed and clearly and determinedly a chick flick . In a sense A Thousand Acres takes off from there , showing us not only the point of view of women , but does so in a way that may seem politically motivated to some . Larry Cook is clearly a bad , bad daddy . He beat his daughters and he had carnal knowledge of them . He ran the household with an iron fist . Jess ( Colin Firth 's character ) seduces the inexperienced Ginny and breaks her heart for nothing more than a bit of fun it would appear . And then he goes to Rose , who clearly is going to be the power behind the new ownership , and hooks up with her , while incidentally inducing her husband to end his life in a drunken accident . The rest of the men are one-dimensional characters without nuance , the way they often appear in romance novels . I think most audiences were put off by the heavy-handed incest , adultery and sexual betrayal that was woven into the story . Having said all this , I think the critics and the public are wrong . I think the direction was biased against men , but in this story it needed to be . I think Moorhouse did a fine job of making an emotional and engaging film about family dynamics that were none too pretty . And the acting by Pfeiffer and Lange was nothing short of sensational .

371,"Be warned , the next time you see "" Richard Kelly "" involved in any production , run away . Fast . Kelly proved to the world after his last movie , "" Southland Tales "" , that he is one pretentious director . It was indulgent and convoluted . In "" The Box "" , not much has changed . I can picture what his pitch to Warner Bros must have been , and I bet the executives at the studio ate it right up : a full-feature film based on one of Richard "" Twilight Zone "" Matheson 's old short stories . Big mistake ! Do not read any further unless you want this movie COMPLETELY spoiled for you : Norma ( Cameron Diaz ) pushes the button . Turns out that Arlington Steward ( Frank Langella ) has an Alien using his body as a vessel to conduct "" experiments "" in which the fate of mankind rests . His face is scarred because he was struck by Alien lightening , which killed him , but then brought him back to life to do all of this red button testing . Obviously since Norma pushes the button , knowing full well that someone may die , she must suffer the consequences for failing to consider someone else 's life instead of her own . In the end she and her husband ( James Marsden ) choose to kill Norma instead of having their son grow up deaf and blind . Kelly dances around his film 's "" message "" , trying to make the audience figure out what the moral of the story is . Obviously , any person with a brain is saying at the beginning , "" What if I was the person who dies ? "" . Richard Kelly does n't even let his character 's have this normal , HUMAN conversation . In fact , they avoid it all together . They appear to both be educated , working at a prestigious school and also for NASA , so why would n't they both have a better ability to LOOK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX ??? If he had the main characters actually have this conversation , the entire movie could have ended right there ! Instead , we have to watch weddings go on forever , NASA and the NSA be complacent to Arlington Stewart taking over these government programs , teleportation to show Marsden life beyond our world so it will be "" easier "" to kill his wife , and drone 's controlled by Steward which can be anywhere and nowhere , at any time . The most painful part of this movie is the pacing . Nothing really happens . Its a muddled mish-mash of ideas that are laughable . It is insufferable how this film is being marketed . The commercials make it look like "" Saw "" and even use the music from those films to sell it . In reality what you get is a slow , dull , laughable ( yes , half the theater was laughing at the acting and visual effects ) , and messy film which is neither imaginative , interesting , nor cohesive . At one point , Cameron Diaz and her son are abducted and then suddenly , she is back in the NSA 's big black car with her husband on the way home . Where did she go ? Why did they take her ? Do we really care ? Not anymore you wo n't . By the end you really wo n't care what happens to any of the characters . You will be rooting for all of them to die so the film will just end .

378,"GUTS OF A BEAUTY is a bit better than its predecessor GUTS OF A VIRGIN . Although this film is n't really a sequel in the sense that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment , I did find BEAUTY to be a little stronger and better put together all-the-way-around than VIRGIN ... but then again , that 's not really saying much . BEAUTY starts off as a pretty rough and straight-faced exploit film . A couple of Yakuza cats are holding a young woman prisoner and begin gang raping her in pretty brutal fashion . As this nastiness is going on , the head guy tells the girl that they did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in Africa , and that they 're gon na do the same to her . They then shoot her up with some drugs and rape her some more . She somehow gets away and ends up at a clinic where the nurse there listens to her sob story . The rapee ends up freaking out from the stress of her prior experience and commits suicide . The clinic worker , moved by the young lady 's story , decides to take revenge on the gang by seducing one of the lower-level guys and trying to hypnotize him to make him kill the Yakuza leaders . This whole plan backfires , so now Ms. Vigilante-Clinic-Worker gets exposed to much the same treatment that our original rapee got - only worse ( some pretty rough butt-rape ensues along with the pre-requisite gang rape ... ) .

381,"I had long wanted to watch this romantic drama ( with a WWII setting ) and , now that I have , all I can say is that it 's a veritable masterpiece of Russian cinema ! Soviet films are known for their overzealous propagandist approach but , thankfully , this one 's free of such emphasis - with the interest firmly on the central tragic romance between a promising artist and a vivacious girl , doomed by the outbreak of war for which he gladly volunteers but from which he 'll never return . The girl ( a remarkable performance from Tatyana Samojlova ) is also loved by the young man 's cousin and , when she does n't receive word from her boyfriend , gives in to the latter and marries him . He , however , is an aspiring concert pianist bitter about the war having curtailed his chances for success and , knowing too that the girl 's still devoted to the soldier , begins to neglect her . Finally , word reaches the girl of her loved one 's death but , by the end of the film , she has learnt to accept this as a sacrifice to their native country and is content to live with her memories of him . The film features some truly amazing camera-work which makes extremely judicious use of the screen space and , by frequently adopting tracking , tilted and high or low angle shots , renders great power to the unfolding emotional drama . Individual sequences are equally impressive - two in particular : the stunning scene , frenetically edited and sped-up to boot , in which the girl saves an abandoned boy from being trampled by a truck ; and the young man 's premature demise in an unfortunate incident at the front , undoubtedly one of the best of its kind I 've ever watched ( with the sun moving away from him , symbolizing the life that 's seeping out of his body , as he imagines the wedding day he 'll never have ! ) . Also notable , however , is the scene where the girl goes to look for her parents in her home that 's been hopelessly devastated during an air raid ; as is her final violent capitulation to the concert pianist - which she tries to resist by repeatedly slapping him in the face - taking place during a later air raid and making particularly effective use of a set of billowing curtains ! Disappointingly , the R1 DVD of this outstanding film is a bare-bones affair ( the RusCiCo edition features a few supplements but , being an export , tends to be heavily overpriced and hard to track down to boot ! ) ; Criterion released it in conjunction with another war-themed Russian classic , BALLAD OF A SOLDIER ( 1959 ) - which my pal at the local DVD rental outlet has told me is forthcoming ... The only other film I 've watched from this director is the Arctic epic THE RED TENT ( 1969 ; albeit via the much-shorter U.S.-release version ! ) , a star-studded international production based on true events ; given the unmistakable artistic quality of THE CRANES ARE FLYING , I regret missing out now on his famous documentary I AM CUBA ( 1964 ) a number of times when I was in Hollywood late last year : apart from receiving a one-week theatrical run , it was shown more than once on TV accompanied by a feature-length "" Making Of "" !!

383,"There are many reasons I 'm not a fan of fact based films , but more than any other is how the filmmakers give themselves creative license over the story . If they have such great imaginations then why not use that talent to make something original ? Otherwise stick to the facts . This could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that . Ed Gein was an insanely frightening human being . It 's been said if you were to take Michael Myers , Jason Voorhees and Leatherface , wrap them into one person , Ed Gein would still be sicker/scarier . So why ca n't someone make a movie about him that can convey this ? When will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction ? I 've read books and watched news programs about him and , now I 'm not a screenwriter or anything , but I believe there 's enough documentation on Gein that it should n't take a whole lot to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never even been documented . I 'm aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders but with all the evidence found in his home and barn there should have been plenty of other ways to put this film together rather than using the deputy 's relationship with his Mother , and girlfriend as filler , and far too much of it . I guess what I 'm wondering is this ... why at the end of the movie did I know more about the supporting characters than I did about Ed Gein ? Why did n't we get to know his Mother , Father and brother and the relationships between them ... what made him the psychopath he was ... what abuse he endured as a child that may have contributed to the man he became ? Instead , the only thing we got of his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy ... running . In the end I give it 4/10 stars . Thats 2 for the gore and 2 for Kane Hodder .

Another reason why the show 's horrible is the acting , Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are terrible , terrible actors . Rappaport has to always move his hands around when he 's in front of the camera , he not only does this on this show but he also did that during his time with "" Boston Public "" . Sullivan talks and acts like some kind of robot every time he acts ( he also did this in "" Malcolm in the Middle "" } . So to wrap this whole thing up , you all got your reasons of what 's wrong with this show 1 . It 's unoriginal 2 . The acting sucks 3 . It 's not even funny 4 . All the jokes are the same 5 . Has lousy script 6 . The characters are pitiful and unlikable 7 . The dad 's a rip-off of Archie Bunker FOX needs to take this trash off the air , because anything 's better than this . ",,
385,"This film flopped miserably in the UK , and it did n't deserve to . The trailer of this film is slightly misleading , and I guess it mislead critics and audiences into thinking it was "" Atonement : Part 2 "" . While the film was marketed that way to capitalise on the earlier success of Joe Wright 's BAFTA-winning film , it 's very different in tone . It focuses on an imagination of sorts of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas ' life during the Second World War as the writer of propaganda films for the war effort , and his subsequent return to Wales . Director John Maybury quickly introduces Dylan 's ( Matthew Ryhs ) childhood sweetheart Vera Phillips , played by Keira Knightley . She was Dylan 's first love in their homeland , but the moment has passed , and singer Vera only wants it as a beautiful memory . Or does she ? Vera unexpectedly strikes up a close bond with the other woman in Dylan 's life , "" Queen of Ireland , love of my life , mother of my child "" Caitlin Thomas ( Sienna Miller ) . The three form a sort of menage a trois in war-struck London , but Vera then falls for a dashing soldier , William Killick ( Cillian Murphy ) . They quickly marry , with Killick leaving for War . A frightened Vera convinces the Thomas ' to return witb her to Wales , but the three are faced with the realism of the birth of Vera 's child , William 's jealousy and shell-shock after returning home , and Caitlin realising she can not share Dylan with her best friend . Filmed on a low budget , this is more of a mood piece than anything else . It works best as a realisation that some memories and feelings need to be treasured but not renewed . The performance of Sienna Miller is particularly excrellent ( unfortunately the paparazzi nonsense detracts from the fact thats she 's quite a talent ) , and Knightley and Murphy are once again very good . The let-down is Rhys as Dylan , who , while the Welsh poet himself was no bed of roses , lacks charisma and makes us wonder what these women see in Dylan . The writing is very choppy , some beautiful moments interspersed with sloppiness . It 's certainly worth watching , however . ","This film flopped miserably in the UK , and it did n't deserve to .

386,"The third entry in the "" Stepford "" franchise , but apparently the three made-for-TV obscure sequels are incredibly obscure and hard to trace down , whereas the 70 's original as well as the blockbuster remake with Nicole Kidman are commonly known and very popular . I have n't seen either the early 80 's "" Revenge of the Stepford Wives "" or the mid 90 's "" The Stepford Husbands "" , but this "" The Stepford Children "" is a quite charming and highly entertaining little film . It 's basically the exact same film as the original ; obviously less mysterious yet much cheesier and incredibly 80 's to the nth degree . The main difference here , like the title implies , is that not just the liberated wives but also the rebellious and punk teenage offspring in town undergoes the typical and highly effective "" Stepford treatment "" , licensed by the local Men 's Association . For some reason the scenario attempts to uphold the Stepford mystery until late in the film , even though nobody is likely to watch this sequel before having checked out the original and presumably everybody also knows about the denouement . The Harding family is all packed and ready to move from the grisly city of New York to the small and peaceful community of Stepford . Particularly father Steven is excited about their new life because he already lived in Stepford and always wanted to go back ever since his first wife , whom his new wife Laura and adolescent children Mary and David know very little about , died under mysterious circumstances . The town is almost too perfect , with picturesque neighbors and model students , and especially the modern teenagers face huge difficulties to adjust . Their efforts to modernize the place and take the local youth of Stanford in tow cause confrontations with the eminent townsfolk , particularly the members of the Men 's Association , and put the familial relationships under a lot of stress . David meets and falls in love with the last "" normal "" girl in school Lois , but when even she transforms into a domestic dummy overnight , David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the sinister Stanford secret . The first hour of "" The Stanford Children "" is slow-paced and rather tame , but the finale is trashy and cheesy like the VHS cover promises and like a late 80 's thriller ought to be , in fact . The modus operandi behind the Stanford secrets is illustrated in greater detail , and I think horror fans and lovers of the original film will appreciate that . At least , I did . The overall plot still does n't make a lot of sense and the script is chock-full of irrational aspects , but it 's nonetheless an engaging formula and undoubtedly one that evokes an atmosphere of suspense and fear .

Yet , it 's the picture 's very strangeness -- a masterfully mounted uncanny atmosphere of pervasively off-kilter supernatural dread which from the get-go registers as powerfully spooky and becomes more increasingly opaque and frightening as the film progresses , offering up ample shocks amid a few scattered moments of surreally lovely dream-like elegance and ending on a bitterly ironic , crushingly nihilistic note with a haunting final image that 's hard to shake -- which makes it such a unique and singularly unnerving experience . Five teenagers traveling through the desolate California desert by car get hopelessly lost . They stumble across "" Slausen 's Lost Oasis , "" a seedy , rundown roadside dive that 's one part gas station , three parts crummy wax museum , and all parts ratty and foreboding . The joint 's lonely , seemingly friendless and harmless owner Slausen ( juicily overplayed with infectiously hammy brio by Chuck Conners ) turns out to be a deranged psychic killer with lethal telekinetic powers . Slausen brings his freaky assortment of uncomfortably human-like mannequins to life and picks off the kids one by one so he can add them to his ever-growing collection of victims . Director David ( "" Puppermaster , "" "" The Arrival "" ) Schmoeller adeptly wrings every last ounce of tension he can squeeze from the pleasingly ambiguous and open-ended script he co-wrote with J. Larry Carroll . ( Said script 's stubborn refusal to provide some rational excuse for all the bizarre stuff which transpires throughout the movie , often wrongly criticized as one of the film 's principal weaknesses , is actually the movie 's key strength , giving the picture the scary , anything-and-everything-can-happen , common-logic-be-damned quality of a true nightmare come horrifically to life which never would have been achieved if there was some kind of credible explanation offered for what 's happening . ) Pino Donaggio 's beautifully chilling , understated score , Nicholas von Sternberg 's shadowy cinematography , and Robert A. Burns ' grubby , cramped production design add immensely to the film 's profoundly unsettling mood . Excellent performances are another significant plus , with the pretty , perky Jocelyn Jones ( Ellie-Jo Turner in "" The Great Texas Dynamite Chase "" ) particularly fine and personable as the most resilient and sympathetic of the endangered teens . Even Tanya Roberts fares well as a luckless lass who has a knife levitated into her head . Offbeat and unusual , "" Tourist Trap "" is well worth visiting .

395,"I wrote spoiler alert , but there 's not really much that can be spoiled . It 's like spoiling rotten meat . This movie is probably the worst I 've ever seen . Not because of the actors or the special effects , but because of the sheer number of mistakes , both factual and physical . First of all , the MIGs are n't actually MIGs at all . They 're Mirages , and they 're French . And how the heck can Doug 's dad withstand the maneuvers his son makes to fight off the "" MIGs "" without a g-suit ? And why would Chappy try to board his plane without a g-suit ? And how could Doug defeat the enemy pilot ace with such ease ? Anyway , I did not like this movie . And the worst part is that it has 3 sequels , the latest one from as late as 1995 . Now that 's scary . ","I wrote spoiler alert , but there 's not really much that can be spoiled .

396,"I actually went into this film with some expectations , not because I thought the film sounded particularly good , but because I 'm a fan of Italian exploitation flicks and with a cast that sees Franco Nero and Telly Savalas starring alongside Oliver Twist , I figured it had to be interesting at least . Well ... RedNeck does have one or two positive things going on , but for the most part ; it 's a dull , lifeless film that is as ridiculous as it is pointless . The plot simply focuses on two criminals ( Nero and Savalas ) who kidnap a young kid ( Oliver ) . The twist in the tale is that the kid realises that he 'd have more fun if he gets accepted into the ' gang ' . Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors that have proved they can carry a film on their own on numerous occasions , and they do have some memorable moments in this film - although really for all the wrong reasons . Savalas in particular gives a silly portrayal of the ' bad ' criminal . The plot does n't flow badly , but since nothing interesting happens , that 's not really a positive point and does n't save from the film from being mediocre . Overall , I ca n't recommend this film ; it may appeal to some for its cult value but it did n't do anything for me .

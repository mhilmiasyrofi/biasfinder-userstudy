4,"I have seen cheesy kung fu fight films. Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in America. I have seen movies make fun of themselves, but this film belongs in the sad category of fight films that try too hard with awful actors, awful props, and awful music to be taken seriously. I seriously felt pity for the person who composed the music for this movie. How sad it must be to be a composer who has to churn out crap like what I thought should have been titled "" Generic Ninja Fight Scene, Op. 1 "" or "" Variations on A Bad Guy Pointing a Gun at a Girl's Head When Backed into a Corner "" or the daring "" Flight of the Helicopter "". Then the fight scenes were over and the credits rolled. Those actually had me in tears laughing. If the "" special effects "" weren't proof enough that this was lowbudget, the fact that only two or three of the crew members, presumably locals which although good for the muchneeded Phillipino economy was probably done solely to save money, have ever done anything since this series of movies. They rented equipment, despite making sequels to this movie. That was pretty funny too. The thing that really had me going though, was not the music ( which left me half expecting an animated Sargeant Slaughter from G.I. Joe to pop up), but the ending ... I suppose this would be a spoiler if there was really a plot to spoil, but when the American Ninja drops the girl into Jackson's arms and then takes off his mask, I wanted to see him jump off the roof and Jackson drop the girl to catch him. I think that would have been the perfect punchline for this joke of a movie.","I have seen cheesy kung fu fight films. Living in Taiwan they come on in lieu of sitcoms in America.

So I was excited to see Journey to the Far Side of the Sun finally get released on an affordable DVD ( the previous print had been fetching$ 100 on eBayI'm sure those people wish they had their money backbut more about that in a second). Anyway, the premise of this film ( just like Twilight Zone's "" The Parallel "") is that there is an undiscovered planet resembling Earth on the "" other side of the sun "". This planet is of course exactly like ours except that it's inverted. This basically means their letters are reversed and people drive on the wrong side of the road. Sound intriguing? Well that's basically all there is to this film. The first hour or so is dedicated to the preparations for the journey to this other planet. It's just tedious scenes of switches being pressed, banal dialog, etc. There's no point to it whatsoever. Gerry Anderson managed to find the most boring British actors in the history of cinema to play most of the roles. I mean they are so dull I'm surprised the crew was able to stay awake to finish the film. Anyway, once the crew FINALLY lands on the planet ( after an interminable sequence of the astronauts sitting and literally sleeping in the cockpit), Roy Thinnes notices the copy is all backwards on a bottle of cologne and hops back on another ship to tell people about what he has discovered. Oops he never gets to do it as he crash lands and dies. The end! Oh wait, there's a bonus scene of one of the space executives hurling himself into a mirror in his wheelchair at the end. I guess he wanted out of this film too. I'm really surprised a film like this could get made even back in the 60s. Rent if you must.

I guess she wanted out of this film too. I'm really surprised a film like this could get made even back in the 60s. Rent if you must. DO NOT BUY.",,
19,"I have tried to like this show, I really have, but I can't find a reason why anyone would like it. The story lines are weak, the acting is weak and unbelievable. Every cast member seems to have been picked up off the street at random. And it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for Jamie Lynn Spears to be able to move on to movies. Every episode shows Zoey as the girl that every girl wants to be her best friend and that every boy wants to date. She's always perfect and no one is like that in real life. How can people relate to a character that is just a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's acting is fair but she is not a strong enough actress to have the lead role in a series. All the show's fans are just young girls who don't know any better. I'm sorry if you think my comments are too harsh but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that isn't quickly directed to a beach partyplease accept my opinions and find something worthwhile to watch.","I have tried to like this show, I really have, but I can't find a reason why anyone would like it.

20,"The main attraction of Anywhere but Here is the superb performance of Natalie Portman. She gave her rather thankless character a lot of muchappreciated emotional depth. Susan Sarandon, a fine actress, is suitably sincere as the mother figure. I thought the chemistry between the two stars was believable, a chemistry that could have been developed more with a more involving script. I am not saying the script was bad in any way, I am just saying it seemed underdeveloped at times. I don't think it was the script writer's fault. The film did suffer from being overlong, and became sometimes unfocused in the longer scenes. The film does look beautiful, with some good direction and excellent performances.

35,"It's hard to believe that a movie this bad wasn't produced once, but four times! Most movies require a certain` suspension of reality ' to enjoy, but this one takes it just too far. The basic scenario is an Air Force pilot who is shot down over a` Middle Eastern ' country. The US government drags its feet in recovering him, leading the Pilot's son ( Doug Masters) to attempt a rescue mission. The problem I have with the movie is that it depicts the US Air Force as one colossal joke. In the movie you'll find that Doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two F-16's, all the munitions, the fuel, the Intel for the mission, and so on. Security on this base seems to be a joke. Nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteenyearold kid is fully qualified to pilot an F-16! If that wasn't enough, you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the munitions right, since people like to see things` blow up '. Not so! Several times in the movie, Doug fires off AIM-9 Missiles on ground targets. AIM stands for` Air Intercept Missile ', meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the AIR. He also fires off 1520 missiles, where the maximum an F-16 can hold is 6 AIM-9's. The movie also lacks continuity. You'll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions, and in the next scene, it has a totally different munitions package. Also, 20MM doesn't just completely destroy anything it touches! An F-16 will hold 500 rounds of 20MM, and it's mostly used for selfdefense. I could go on forever with plot holes, flaws, and outright wrong information from the movie, but I won't bore you. If you're in the mood to see a good Air Force movie, your choices are rather slim. Most military movies deal either with the Army, Navy or Marines. Until Hollywood can come up with an Air Force movie on the lines of` Saving Private Ryan ' or` A Few Good Men ', we'll be forced to watch movies like the` Iron Eagle ' series.","It's hard to believe that a movie this bad wasn't produced once, but four times!

He also fires off 1520 missiles, where the maximum an F-16 can hold is 6 AIM-9's. The movie also lacks continuity. You'll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions, and in the next scene, it has a totally different munitions package. Also, 20MM doesn't just completely destroy anything it touches! An F-16 will hold 500 rounds of 20MM, and it's mostly used for selfdefense. I could go on forever with plot holes, flaws, and outright wrong information from the movie, but I won't bore you. If you're in the mood to see a good Air Force movie, your choices are rather slim. Most military movies deal either with the Army, Navy or Marines. Until Hollywood can come up with an Air Force movie on the lines of` Saving Private Ryan ' or` A Few Good Men ', we'll be forced to watch movies like the` Iron Eagle ' series.",,

38,"Idiocracy is the latest film to come from Mike "" Office Space "" Judge, and it certainly follows a similar theme of that film in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity ... relatively speaking. It is a story about Joe Bauer ( Luke Wilson), who is, quite literally, the most average guy in existence. Joe, and a prostitute named Rita ( Maya Rudolph), become the test subjects for a military project of a hibernation chamber. They were to remain suspended for only one year, but due to lack of oversight, Joe and Rita are forgotten about and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future. Here's the scary part: This film explains, in a very realistic and plausible way, how the entire population of 2505 became absolutely retarded. With no natural predators, the evolution of the human species does not necessarily favor the quickest, smartest, and strongest people for progression of genes ... just the people who breed the most. Unfortunately, those people happen to be welfaresucking, trailer trash idiots who breed like rabbits. This abundant reproduction of the stupid people has caused an adverse effect on societal growth and now Joe and Rita are the two smartest human beings on the face of the planet. If it helps, imagine the entire population as just a hybrid of rednecks, jocks, cholos and hoochies. Seeing this nightmarish dystopia, Joe learns of and attempts to track down a time machine to see if he and Rita can get back to when they came from, and that's basically the whole plot. But despite how onedimensional I may make it sound, this movie is higher brow than you can fathom. Nuances are everywhere and anyone can see glimpses ( warning signs, if you will) of modern day dumbciety permeating facets of everyday life and turning it into the train wreck on display in "" Idiocracy. "" The film has some truly awesome showcases of realistic retardedness put on a pedestal. I don't want to give anything away and ruin jokes for you, but let's just say that it is pretty thorough. I can see how some would say that it is just a lot of toilet humor, but it, odd as it may seem, has a purpose; to show how dumb and crass these people are. This film, unfortunately, is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, "" Office Space ""; no one will see it in theaters, but everyone will brag about discovering this awesome/ funny movie when it comes out on video. My only complaint for the film would be that the flow of the narrative sometimes gets broken so they can do a Hitchhiker'sGuidetotheGalaxy type exposition on how things got to be where they are, but it is a necessary evil and is implemented better here. Other than that, good characters, funny jokes, and betterthanaverage social commentary wrapped up in a funny bow. Final Note: If seeing our youth becoming gangbanger wannabe's, acting like redneck/ ghetto trash and being proud of it ... if you are educated and cultured in anyway and can see how our country is spiraling out of control into an abyss of stupidity, for god sakes, watch this movie.","Idiocracy is the latest film to come from Mike "" Office Space "" Judge, and it certainly follows a similar theme of that film in the fact that it is an observation of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome adversity ... relatively speaking.

39,"I won't waste your time by describing the plot for this, the other reviewer already did this quite well. I will however give you my opinion of this movie. This movie is basically anti japanese propoganda. The japanese are portrayed as incredably evil b**tards who have respect for nothing, as well as having very poor martial arts skills ( groups of japanese men get there asses kicked by single women on more than one occasion.) The fact that the japanese fighters lose almost every ( if not every) fight in the movie kind of takes away the suspense. The plot is actually quite solid and perfect for a kung fu movie though. The problem lies in the fact that there's not much fighting. When there are fights some of the fighting is quite good, but other scenes are choreographed badly. One scene angela mao takes on six japanese in a church and kicks all their asses. The problem is they show her fighting them one by one when they're all supposed to be attacking at the same time. I gather this movie was incredably cheap considering how cheap some of the sets are. They use the same village set for when they are in korea and when they are in china without changing it at all. Some scenes are filmed at real locations though, and they look good. Overall the only real problem with the movie is it's slow moving and uninteresting plot. Since there are few fight scenes we have to rely on the plot for entertainment and, well, I wasn't entertained. one and a half stars out of four","I won't waste your time by describing the plot for this, the other reviewer already did this quite well.

The setting is the American suburb, too familiar from ' American Beauty ' or ' Desperate Housewives '. As in ' American Beauty'the film turns around a suicide, but here it happens at the beginning of the movie, and we are left watching a midclass family coping with the death of the gifted sportsman brother and son. Emile Hirsch plays the younger brother, Sigourney Weaver is the mother, both are excellent trying to cope with the loss, to find the reason and motivation to survive. Harris drives his actors with a sure hand, and the first two sections of the film ( there are four in total, as the seasons of the year) build a wonderful tension, with credible dilemmas and real questions. It is the second part of the film that disappoints slightly, it looks too tired and conventional, and I suspect that the producers may have interfered in the work of the young scriptwriter and director, trying to bring him closer to the Hollywood convention. That's how this film fails to be a somber version of ' American Beauty ', with a different focus.

I'm all for fake boobage and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie? Really there's nothing worse than the reheated secondhand leftovers of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about 70's grindhouse cinema because Hell Ride has none of the raw and unpolished feel of the era it purports to pay homage to. No, this is slick and glossy MTV Hollywood through and through. The old trend I'm talking about is the selfconsciously pseudohip quirky cinematic world where Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. All three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason. Hell Ride is just a secondhand copy, fickle and uninspired, polished to the max when it should be raw, the "" supercool "" aspect coming off forced and silly. There's no reason for example why such a simple and utterly inane story has to be told in convoluted, backandforth in time fashion. It's just a postTarantino quirk. There's also no reason why the dialogues have to be so mindnumbingly pointless, people flapping their gums while saying NOTHING: at least when Travolta was talking about cheeseburgers in Pulp Fiction it felt fresh. Dialogues here amount to little more than pseudomacho posturing. There's also no reason why a grating rock'n'roll guitar has to twangle aimlessly over the entire movie. Perhaps the lowest Hell Ride hits is when it tries to be quasiexistential. There's a hilarious dream/ illusion scene in the desert where Bishop eats peyote and sees colours. I was halfexpecting an old Indian to come out and offer nuggets of wisdom. The only saving grace of this abysmal turd is the boobage and Vinnie Jones ' monologue about his wings tattooes ( and maybe some of the desert exterior shots). Lots of boobage and hot scantily clad babes. Now that's something I can get behind but a movie they don't make.

That was over 24 years ago and I haven't seen the movie since. This time around I cringed at some of the acting but still appreciate the film for what it is. Life is not always fair and the good guys don't always win in fact I think the movie did well to reflect that especially as a teenager the pricks always did better with a lot of girls. Also it doesn't matter how nice you are you can not make someone like you. Girls/ boys like who they want to like no matter how hard you try otherwise. Sometimes you just got ta let go and say next. Alfred does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings for Karen. This is so true of teenagers when they get fixated on someone. I remember sitting around with mates laughing our arses off at some of the antics. The acting is not quite there compared with Fast Times at Ridgemount High but it kicks ass over this movie simply because FTARH has a lame viewer friendly ending where as this movie has a realistic ending. Nice guys finish last!! Alfred comes across as pretty lame cringe worthy material but we all know guys like this who are far to sensitive. We all know a David, fun guy who makes you laugh. Some people on here bag the ending but hello the ending is exactly what can happen in real life. Some chicks just go back for more no matter how bad the dude treats them, especially at that age. I have experienced that first hand. Great sound track too!! U2 "" I will follow ""Jesus is it that old??",,

I have read many biographies and seen other things about the Carpenters, and this movie did what it could, based on the constraints placed on it by the family. Cynthis Gibb did a wonderful job trying to bring Karen to life. One of my disappointments is that there was not more insight into Karen's anorexia. In the reading I have done about the disease ( especially Cherry Boone O'Neill's wonderful book, Starving for Attention) anorexia appears to be a disease of control. Karen saw her weight as one thing in her life that she could control. She felt that she was being controlled in every other aspect of her life. Don't get me wrong, I believed she truly loved the music, but she felt she had little control over her career. She truly loved her family, but they did not express it well, and she didn't know how to make her family understand her. The film could have touched so much more on that.

79,"It was AMAZING. As a librarian and an attendee at the New York Library Association's Vitality Fund Event on Thursday night, October 18, I was privileged to see a prerelease screening of the new movie, The Kite Runner. The release of the movie has been delayed because of concerns about the welfare of the child actors involved. I am grateful that the NYLA event was allowed to go on as planned. Regarding the movie, I feel it was masterfully done. It had as much impact on me, I think, as Stanley Kubrik's A Clockwork Orange, even though it is much less graphicMUCH less. There is no comparison between the horrendous, shocking violence and rape shown in A Clockwork Orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in Kite Runner; only the subject matter and the implications for the human psyche are comparable. ( I have written more details about the violence and child rape and how it was handled on my MySpace blog.) My overall impression was that this film was fantastic; one of the bestmade films I have seen. The depiction of the Afghani boys flying their kites captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. The subject matter is intensely serious, and the movie carries the emotions of the audience into that subject matter without many jarring "" Hollywood touches "" which have ruined other movies. Although the overturned cart of pomegranates was an obvious bit of symbolism ( to me). Finally, I must mention the excellence of the sound track. The recitation by the boy of poetry by Rumi as two main characters are fleeing the country during the Russian invasionunder terrifying circumstancestruly showed the power of those poems. I urge anyone watching to disregard the subtitles in that scene to the extent that you can, and just listen to the beauty of the language. I don't even know what language Amir is quoting, whether his normal Dari Persian dialect is the same as Rumi's original Persian dialect. Also, please note the sound heard every time a kite line is cut. I found it a profound, distinctive sound, though the librarians who were with me did not notice it at all. I can't help but wonder if kites actually make a sound like that when they are "" cut "", or if it gives a sense of the vibration/ sound experienced by the kite flyer during competition.","It was AMAZING. As a librarian and an attendee at the New York Library Association's Vitality Fund Event on Thursday night, October 18, I was privileged to see a prerelease screening of the new movie, The Kite Runner. The release of the movie has been delayed because of concerns about the welfare of the child actors involved. I am grateful that the NYLA event was allowed to go on as planned. Regarding the movie, I feel it was masterfully done. It had as much impact on me, I think, as Stanley Kubrik's A Clockwork Orange, even though it is much less graphicMUCH less. There is no comparison between the horrendous, shocking violence and rape shown in A Clockwork Orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in Kite Runner; only the subject matter and the implications for the human psyche are comparable.

87,"John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story. The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery needed to keep the film heading in the right direction. Be it an horrific scene or a "" what is in the shadow "" sequence, the film to me is a perfect fusion of horror and scifi. The dialogue is spot on for a group of men trying to keep it together under duress, and Carpenter's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming thru the film. The cast are superb, a solid assembly of actors led by Carpenter fave Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used give the right amount of impact needed.

96,"I have read both the book and saw the movie today. The storyline is so powerful that almost any script or screenplay would have done justice to it. So nothing much there. However, this is still a beautiful movie because it makes one think and feel, just like the book. Watching it is not like watching a documentary on a failed state and feeling sympathetic towards people suffering under an oppressive regime, but is like watching any other common man's story unfold, across generations, across continents. Amir's cowardice, his guilt, his dilemmas and finally his choosing a way of redemption could have been a story of any of us. There isn't a single infallible character to look up to and idolize but all of them are gray, just like all of us. Another important observation is that the movie does a great job of chronicling the lives of Afghans through the twenty some years of turbulent political scenarios. The vibrant, carefree childhood represents Kabul before the Russian invasion and the desolate, shattered remains of the city echo what the Taliban has done to it. The child actors deserve ' thumbs up ' all the way. They can put any matured actor to shame. If you have not yet seen the movie or read the book, just walk into the theater keeping in mind that you are going to witness a multilayered story woven on a multicolored fabric of human emotions and sentiments.

98,"A film to divide its viewers. Just criticism points at its funereal pace, overused snap zooms and persistent, lingering gazes between the protagonists. Advocates point to Dirk Bogarde's mighty performance and Pasqualino De Santis ' benchmark photography of Venice. Taken altogether, this might suggest an indulgent, romanticised elegy for the nobility of homosexual love ( at a time, 1971, when it was becoming consensually legal). In fact Visconti has succeeded in making a richer, more complex film than such a singleissue vehicle. He has knit his ideasfoibles and allinto a meticulously paced arc. Inside this does indeed sit the central performance of Bogarde's Aschenbach. Rather than a simpering, Johnnycomelately gay, he manages to give a pathetic composer beaten by tragedy and misunderstood integrity who sees salvation in Tadzio. His mesmerised staggering around an increasingly hellish Venice after the boy is a straight metaphor for the artist's tenacity for truth in the teeth of the dilettante mob ( and it is explicitly cut with such a flashback). Mahler's music is possibly a little overused although it is well appropriated. The Italian overdub is a wearing anachronism but thankfully the acting doesn't suffer too much. 7/10","A film to divide its viewers.

Still the plot is ridiculous and it would've been nicer if we could've seen a monster or at least more gore. At least it's something different.

126,"This film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen. The writer obviously bought the playbook "" How to write a space disaster movie "" and followed it play by play. In particular, the stereotypical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer spaceputting on a brave show in the face of disasterhas been done time and time again. Max Q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw$ 50 million at the project. But, judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects, the producers could only muster$ 50 thousand. To learn that the film was nominated for a "" Special Visual Effects "" Emmy has me absolutely gobsmacked. I think a handful of high school students with a pass in Media Studies could have created more believable effects! And the plot holes are too numerous to mention. But I will pick one out as an example. Now, I'm no NASA expert, but surely it's highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pearshaped with the program. Surely there is someone more experienced at Mission Control who the Program Director would call on rather than a twentynine year old who has not been in the control room before. The only saving grace for this film is the work of Bill Campbell. He manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script. I give this film 2 out of 10, with the aboveaverage work of Bill Campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark.","This film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen.

Nicholas Grace does an excellent job and must have had a great time being the Sheriff. His whipping boy, Sir Guy, is equally hissable but is also pathetic. Lots of murder and mayhem in this series, along with tons of black magic and Devil worship and things of that nature. I noticed it got an award for children's television which is surprising.

It's an homage to all the stars of the great TV western classics, and it is the ultimate revival of the western movie. The story of two brothers who meet after the War between the States and end up on different sides of the law isn't new but interesting nonetheless, and the shootouts and the atmosphere are great. There is some graphic violence like bad guys getting chopped to death with an axe or women being shot down in cold blood, and Lee Majors doesn't take part in the action until the very end, that's why I gave it 9 out of 10 points. But it still is one of the best new western productions I've ever seen. I've had the honor and pleasure to meet Chris McIntyre at the Festival of the West and have a nice chat with him, and I've had the chance to meet Buck Taylor who performs the role of town doctor. In my opinion, we ought to be much obliged to Chris McIntyre for his efforts to gather that many stars of the classic TV westerns and SASS around him to perform in a new western such as this. Chris has an outstanding talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters, too. Both are young and promising, and I think we should see more of them in future western productions. I sincerely enjoyed this western movieit was worth every minute. I hope that Chris McIntyre will continue to work on other western movies and present us with some more great productions such as this one. Great work, Chris! Jasper P.

160,"I just can't understand why people are surprised this movie makes no sense. It was never supposed to make sense. ( Duh! The writers were completely wasted on Frodis at the time.) It was just supposed to entertain and mock, and it does both wonderfully. The Monkees are good actors. They wouldn't have been hired if they weren't good actors. Mike has a thing for deadpan and darkness, Micky is the best at sheer psychotic comedy, Davy is a Broadway veteran, and Peter actually had people believing he was that dumb in real life. Don't tell me they can't act, because they most definitely can. They can also write. Sure, Jack & Bob get the sole credits, but in reality, they got a big helping hand on that script from the Monkees, who were also in that smokefilled room. ( it is absolutely impossible to spoil this film) Head is very highly symbolic. Among the more memorable elements is the black box, which was actually based on 2 things: the Monkee image that the boys were bound to, and the real black box on the Screen Gems lot where the band was kept between takes. There's so much more symbolism in the movie that I'll just let you watch it and figure it out. The music is awesome. "" Circle Sky "" is one of Papa Nez's best tunes ever, and "" Porpoise Song "" & "" As We Go Along "" will have you enthralled. If you'd rather be weirded out, then "" Ditty Diego "", "" Can You Dig It? "", and "" Long Title "" should be satisfactory, great songs that they are. And then there's "" Daddy's Song "", without a doubt a homage to Davy's Broadway days, and the editing/ color scheming for that sequence is superb. ( At least for ' 68.) Oh, For those of you who won't watch a ' PG ' film, you're missing out. Especially since Head was originally rated R in 1968. The rating was lowered about TWENTY years later! Now where was I?

167,"David Lynch's ninth full length feature film, Mulholland Drive is a deeply touching story about betrayal and jealousy. If anything, it brutally contrasts our ambitions and hopes to the often bitter truth. Every frame of this movie has importance and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. Nothing is what it first appears to be and you're left with a real puzzle as you end up trying to put the pieces together. It is a movie that does not compromise, nor does it fail to fully handle the challenging form and camera language, as might have been the case earlier with Lost Highway. Although one clearly recognizes classic lynchian motifs and devices, the movie remains highly original, even in the light of it being a Lynch movie. Lost Highway marked a new way of telling a story; bred an unconventional mean of setting emotions on to the screen. With Mulholland Drive, Lynch not only managed to control this technique, but takes it to new levels in making it much more complex and multi dimensional. In doing this, he creates a framework of different layers in time and of the human mind. In a press conference on the Cannes film festival 2001, David Lynch said that striving for perfection at best could give a result where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Talking about synergies like this becomes highly relevant to Mulholland Dr. where the different sequences and many details contribute to the total; dreamscapes and parallels intertwine to create the story. In some art, the beauty of it lies in its simpleness. This is not the case with Mulholland Drive, and has never been with Lynch. It is the complexity that colors and builds the worlds Lynch creates, the same complexity that characterizes the real world. It never gets forced like, in my opinion, for example Memento does, using an original way of communicating with the viewers. Further comparing Mulholland Drive to other movies, I think it proves David Lynch as a master of what he does and bridges art and film making in a way that no one has ever done. Compared to for example Alejandro Jodorowsky or contemporary Matthew Barney, I do believe that Lynch more clearly manages not letting the artist dominate the film maker or, more likely, David Lynch better understands and executes film making as an art form. Understanding the plot is no small feat, but Lynch's way of working with sound, perspective, chronology and form paints a work of art so dark and frightening that it sometimes feels more realistic than real life. The lynchian cinema is often, and most definitely in Mulholland Drive, a surge of human emotions. Working with emotions is a delicate craft that demands understanding and depth. As Lynch puts it: "" A little bit too much, and the emotion goes away. A little bit too little, and it doesn't happen. "" In Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has no problem making this balance. Lynch's portraits span all kinds of dimensions and take different directions, creating incredibly realistic characters and situations. Watching Mulholland Drive is a journey through the subconscious. It is a truthful and naked movie with indisputable artistic value. That is why I love Mulholland Drive and what's taken it to the pinnacle of cinema history. The ultimate movie.","<name> 's ninth full length feature film, Mulholland Drive is a deeply touching story about betrayal and jealousy.

169,"As someone who used to spend hours driving around the backstreets of North London in an attempt to avoid the horrific congestion, this film immediately appealed. Throw in my interest in what London was like back in the late 70s and you have the basic premise for my version of TV heaven! On paper the film ticked all the right boxes, and having just watched "" The Knowledge "" the actual movie itself certainly lived up to, if not exceeded, my high expectations. Visually, I was surprised how different London looked back then ( I lived in Islington in the 90s, long after gentrification had transformed the area). It truly came across as grimy, tatty and downatheel. London may still have bad housing estates, but the general feel of the place is much cleaner, brighter and pleasant nowadays ( based on what this movie shows rather than my own memories). As for the story and the acting, well top marks obviously go to Nigel Hawthorne as The Vampire. Absolutely brilliant! He acts deliberately unpredictably, alternating between total straightfaced severity and surreal mindgames in order to unnerve the Knowledge Boys as he puts them through test after test. All in all this was an excellent, thoroughly enjoyable trip back into a very specific time and place that I find endlessly fascinating. But even if you're not especially interested in London circa 1979, you'll still enjoy following the witty dialogue and likable characters of "" The Knowledge "".","As someone who used to spend hours driving around the backstreets of North London in an attempt to avoid the horrific congestion, this film immediately appealed.

On paper the film ticked all the right boxes, and having just watched "" The Knowledge "" the actual movie itself certainly lived up to, if not exceeded, my high expectations. Visually, I was surprised how different London looked back then ( I lived in Islington in the 90s, long after gentrification had transformed the area). It truly came across as grimy, tatty and downatheel. London may still have bad housing estates, but the general feel of the place is much cleaner, brighter and pleasant nowadays ( based on what this movie shows rather than my own memories). As for the story and the acting, well top marks obviously go to Rebecca as The Vampire. Absolutely brilliant! She acts deliberately unpredictably, alternating between total straightfaced severity and surreal mindgames in order to unnerve the Knowledge Boys as she puts them through test after test. All in all this was an excellent, thoroughly enjoyable trip back into a very specific time and place that I find endlessly fascinating. But even if you're not especially interested in London circa 1979, you'll still enjoy following the witty dialogue and likable characters of "" The Knowledge "".",,

172,"Patsy Kensit and some random Australian bloke star as a duo of wannabe tough coppers in the middle of investigating a series of artgallery related murders, but in between they can still find the time to shoot juvenile shoplifters and suspect the brand new wife of the male cop of being adulterous. The serial killer suddenly isn't important anymore when the supposed lover of the wife ( who's basically just a coworker of hers) is found murdered and the male cop becomes prime suspect. "" Tunnel Vision "" is a really dull, implausible and tensionfree Aussie thriller that obviously imitates popular sexthrillers like "" Fatal Attraction "", "" Disclosure "" and "" Basic Instinct "". The characters are extremely onedimensional and pretty much every goodcop/ badcop clich is extendedly described in the script. The struggling position of police women in a corps full of men, the shootfirstaskquestionslater mentality, alcohol problems through stress, etc etc   Even the unhealthy eating habits of cops are a running gag. Yawn! Kensit really tries her best to make this film more bearable, but she lacks the credibility and talent of a real cinema heroine. The endtwist is more or less interesting ( not at all original, mind you) but, by then, you stopped caring for the characters a long time already. The scenes filmed inside the sex clubs look ludicrously fake and Clive Fleury's directing is completely uninspired. What a total waste of time","<name> and some random Australian bloke star as a duo of wannabe tough coppers in the middle of investigating a series of artgallery related murders, but in between they can still find the time to shoot juvenile shoplifters and suspect the brand new wife of the male cop of being adulterous.

Stereotyping and racism are present, but not to a winceinducing degree. Further, for a movie of its time, it's pretty frank -- the adultery, violent behavior, drug use, and selfdestructive habits of the denizens of Catfish Row are not at all minimized in the telling. But there are debits, beginning with all that variation from the stage text. The loss of so much compromises Gershwin's brilliance -- no wonder the family doesn't like it. The reorchestration, especially of Sammy Davis Jr.'s material, is disconcertingly trendy and vulgar. George knew what he was doing, folks; you didn't have to mess with it so much. And while Poitier and Dandridge act well and their singing doubles sing well, there's a huge chasm between the characters ' singing and speaking voices -- you're constantly aware of the artifice.

198,"La Antena, an audacious film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, succeeds both as a reinvention of the silent movie genre and a gripping cautionary tale. The setting is a city in thrall to mindless television, its people deprived of the power of speech except for a solitary and mysterious screen presence known simply as The Voice. In a bid to cement their grip on power the marvellously villainous duo of television mogul Mr. TV and mad scientist Dr. Y set out to kidnap The Voice and turn her unique talent towards their own dastardly ends. It is up to a young family and The Voice's nameless, eyeless son to stop this evil scheme. The result is a roller coaster of a story that is bewildering on occasion but never less than engrossing. This is a silent movie that wears many of its influences on its sleeve; the overt references to silent movie greats such as George Melies and Fritz Lang will be readily apparent to anyone with a passing familiarity of their work. But more subtle references and symbolism lie behind such tributes. I particularly like the fact that Mr. TV and his henchman drive around in typical 1930s gangster cars, drawn from the decade when the silent movie era died away and a very different industry began to emerge. La Antena mines the clichd plot devices and theatrical overacting common to so many silent films, albeit in a very knowing and humorous way. It is the astonishing visual style of La Antena that really sets it apart from the movies that it pays homage to. From the hypnotic TV logo to the menacing hilltop transmission station, this film abounds with dazzling visual inventiveness that is the rival of a Studio Ghibli animation   and all this using real actors and handmade sets. Moreover, though the style is often intentionally corny and theatrical, this is still an unsettling, provocative and emotional picture. The use of religious symbolism throughout La Antena lends added resonance to the struggle between the TV Empire and the waning power of words. At the same time, many of the most powerful images are original ones, including the hypnotic swirl of the television sets and the nightmarish TV food factory. I hate to end this review on a sour note, but I feel that the Englishlanguage release of La Antena is let down by the subtitles. The original Spanish subtitles are used to great effect, with much playing around with words on screen. However, the Englishlanguage subtitles that accompany the original dialogue are frustratingly incomplete, with omissions and mistakes at times leaving the viewer to piece things together for themselves. La Antena is nevertheless a striking piece of cinema; a visually breathtaking experience that displays great energy and humour whilst narrating a powerful cautionary tale.","La Antena, an audacious film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, succeeds both as a reinvention of the silent movie genre and a gripping cautionary tale.

199,"DoItYourself indie horror auteur Todd Sheets returns with another entertainingly atrocious nickel'n'dime shotonvideo clunker that's basically just a feeble excuse to sling around a lot of watery blood and gleaming guts as often as possible. An evil demonic scarecrow resurrects the dead as ravenous rotfaced zombies so they can feast on the living. A bunch of bickering college kids, a trio of dangerous escaped convicts led by the vicious Slade ( Byron Nichodemus hamming it up to an outrageous degree), two equally savage sleazeball hoodlums, and a trio of hottie sisters all have to do their best to survive this harrowing ordeal. That's it for the needlessly muddled and convoluted plot, but fortunately what this hilariously horrendous hoot lacks in narrative coherence ( plenty) it more than compensates for with a pleasing plethora of gloriously gross'n'graphic gore. Disgusting highlights include a woman having her fingers chopped off, a fatal gunshot to a young gal's groin, attempted necrophiliac rape, evisceration, and, of course, more repulsive entrail eating than you can shake a pile of moist intestines at. Moreover, we've also got rough, grainy cinematography that constantly alternates between washedout color and grimy black and white, ineptly staged fight scenes, lousy acting from a uniformly pathetic noname cast ( Jerry Angell in particular cops the top crummy thespic dishonors for his laughably abysmal histrionics as slimy nocount psycho criminal Joe Bob), a grating headbanging thrash metal soundtrack, and a generic shivery'n'ominous synthesizer score. Let's not forget the ridiculous ending in which several of our survivors stumble across a few vials of flesheating bacteria to use on the shambling undead hordes. Sure, this flick is pure dreck, but it has a certain endearingly abominable quality to it that in turn makes it a great deal of soawfulit'sawesome Grade Z fun for hardcore aficionados of bad fright fare.","DoItYourself indie horror auteur Todd Sheets returns with another entertainingly atrocious nickel'n'dime shotonvideo clunker that's basically just a feeble excuse to sling around a lot of watery blood and gleaming guts as often as possible.

213,"The debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured, if limited, stab at the con game and obsession. Filmed for zero money, Nolan couldn't have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of London to ply his trade, given the lack of funds. This short ( 67 min) is at its best in playing with the audience's and protagonist's expectations about who is scamming whom, though the initial setup does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept. The muddy cinematography ( he often used natural lighting due to budget) can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization, though the limitations do show at times.

217,"A brilliant horror film. Utterly gruesome and very scary too. The Thing is a remake from John Carpenter, but please, do not let that put you off this film. It is simply brilliant. The start of the film has the alien's spacecraft hurtling towards the Earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film's title in amazing shining white and blue stating ' THE THING '. One of the best opening credits for a horror film ever. The cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their Station in Antartica is visually impressive on DVD widescreen. It must have been great in the cinema. I regret not seeing this on the big screen. Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected. My favourite scene in the whole film has to be when Macready tests everyone that s still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and finally spectacular. I love it because its funny as well. Special mention must go to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself. If he didn't get an Oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have. This is also debatable as to whether this is John Carpenter's greatest film ... its certainly a gruesome masterpiece. Wait for a cold winter night. Get some Budweiser from the fridge.

223,"I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time. I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it   This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie. I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound, editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised ( Rightly too) these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Robert Duvall in particular have also been noted, and everyone else has mentioned the stark imagery of the Dou Long bridge and the montage of the boat traveling upriver after passing through the border   How about the script? Francis Ford Coppola is best known as a director but he's everyway a genius as a screenwriter as he was as a director, I said "" was "" in the past tense because making this movie seems to have burned out every creative brain cell in his head, but his sacrifice was worth it. In John Milius original solo draft we have a script that's just as insane and disturbing as the one on screen, but Coppola's involvement in the screenplay has injected a narrative that exactly mirrors that of war. Check how the screenplay starts off all jingoistic and macho with a star turn by Bill Kilgore who wouldn't have looked out of place in THE GREEN BERETS but the more the story progresses the more shocking and insane everything becomes, so much so that by the time reaches Kurtz outpost the audience are watching another film in much the same way as the characters have sailed into another dimension. When Coppola states "" This movie isn't about VietnamIt is Vietnam "" he's right. What started off as a patriotic war to defeat communist aggression in the mid 1960s had by the film's setting ( The Manson trial suggests it's 1970) had changed America's view of both the world and itself and of the world's view of America   It's the insane beauty of APOCALYPSE NOW that makes it a masterwork of cinema and says more in its running time about the brutality of conflict and the hypocrisy of politicians ( What did you do in the Vietnam War Mr President?) than Michael Moore could hope to say in a lifetime. I've not seen the REDUX version but watching the original print I didn't feel there was anything missing from the story which like all truly great films is very basic.

The focus of the film is the union between Ullman and Von Sydow -- the two are in every scene.

Both will lose a measure of humanity, but one to a greater degree than the other. The characters and the viewer go through periods of fluctuation in regards to closeness -- the camera pulls out and away, sound disappears, words are lost, only for the camera to return to painterly closeups of its facially expressive stars. The confusion and fluctuation may make this film hard for some viewers, but this is all purposeful under the master hand of Bergman.

Advocates point to Dirk Bogarde's mighty performance and Pasqualino De Santis ' benchmark photography of Venice. Taken altogether, this might suggest an indulgent, romanticised elegy for the nobility of homosexual love ( at a time, 1971, when it was becoming consensually legal). In fact Visconti has succeeded in making a richer, more complex film than such a singleissue vehicle. He has knit his ideasfoibles and allinto a meticulously paced arc. Inside this does indeed sit the central performance of Bogarde's Aschenbach. Rather than a simpering, Johnnycomelately gay, he manages to give a pathetic composer beaten by tragedy and misunderstood integrity who sees salvation in Tadzio. His mesmerised staggering around an increasingly hellish Venice after the boy is a straight metaphor for the artist's tenacity for truth in the teeth of the dilettante mob ( and it is explicitly cut with such a flashback). Mahler's music is possibly a little overused although it is well appropriated.

In fact, this movie is sort of a cross between Xmen and the matrix and it came out before either. Wesley Snipes does a great job with the character of Blade. He is just not an emotionless super hero. Also, this movie isn't sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. Sure comic books are for kids mainly, but I like a little more in my movies. Let's face it, if we were in these situations we would cuss up a storm to so it is more realistic. This comic book adaptation also has something that many don't. A good fight in the end between the bad guy and good guy. Let's face it, none of the Batman movies had a very good ending fight.","This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again and not get tired of it.

241,"Speed which I believe is direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular ( I haven't watched this one) gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days, but then gets in a very boring draw at the end. I have watched this movie today on 12th January 2008 on rented VCD. It's release date is 19th Oct 2007. But still fortunately for me I didn't know or heard much of this movie before except that it is a flop at box office. So in this situation when I watch the movie, I feel that this movie could have been a very good movie, but then the director again falls in the trap for Bollywood traditions and has wasted a very good chance. Off course as a Bhatt movie it must be copied from somewhere else. But now days it doesn't matter for me, if I haven't seen the original movie. I just found the main theme much similar to ' Nick of Time ' and ' Badshah '. In the movie Sanjay Suri is shown an intelligence agent, but his wife thinks that he is a chef. This brings back the memory of ' TrueLies '. The only new part was the use if the phone. But that too I found out now is taken from movie Cellular. So when a movie is made with the mixture of so many other movies it's future is quite clear. The things I like about the movie is its pace. As the name suggest the things really happens fast, and there is not much time to think about in between the scenes. But this breaks in the last 20 minutes of so where the movie goes in traditional Bollywood style of Dhishum dhishum. The plot of the movie is also quite interesting. Three stories going parallel, one after the other. One of the kidnapping of Urmila, the other of the Zayed trying to help Urmila, and then the plan of murder of prime minister. These three stories gets mixed up naturally with each other as the movie continues. But then the very ordinary acting and unnecessary extra style has killed the spirit of the movie. Except Sanjay Suri, none other makes any impression. This goes even for Urmila, who is always promising in RGVs movies. Due to this ordinary acting some scenes doesn't really convey the feelings that director wanted. E.g. the scene at the end where Urmila leaves all hope and cut the phone, should have made a good impact. But instead we just wait for the end of that scene. Other than acting, some unnecessary love for style demoralizes the movie. Showing so cool villains is good for Hollywood movies not for Bollywood The background of London is also only for making style and not much intelligent advantage of this background can be seen. Especially at the end, all those dhishhum- dhishhum were utterly unnecessary. May be director has an impression that the climax in Hindi movies must have such fights. They look unrealistic, increase the length of the movie and make sure that the people are leaving theater before the movie ends. Over and all, I find the movie once watchable. If it is coming on TV or you can get it on rent its OK. But then again make sure that you have the remote and forward button handy. Next time, when the movie is on TV, you can safely watch other channels.","Speed which I believe is direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular ( I haven't watched this one) gives an impression of a test match which is very exciting in first four days, but then gets in a very boring draw at the end.

Throughout, he is usually more poised and selfpossessed than Jamal, which could have been the germ of a nice exploration of the contrasts in the relationship but wasn't developed very far. But the inexperience of the writer/ director/ cinematographer/ etc. is no excuse for his inattention. Has he ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Has he ever heard of a closeup? Even Ed Wood could do a closeup. I don't think it's much of a budget issue. I could only give a general description of what any of the actors look like, and not just because of no closeups, but the lighting ...!

Neil wants to be Chris Tucker ( whom I've always found very annoying), as a previous commentator has noted, but Peanut ( Edward D. Smith), while some of his ( over)reactions go on way too long ( a director's problem), has some comparatively subtle and funny moments, such as when he is trying to instruct Neil on the proper method of smoking a joint with a buddy. Throughout, he is usually more poised and selfpossessed than Jamal, which could have been the germ of a nice exploration of the contrasts in the relationship but wasn't developed very far. But the inexperience of the writer/ director/ cinematographer/ etc. is no excuse for his inattention. Has he ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Has he ever heard of a closeup? Even Ed Wood could do a closeup. I don't think it's much of a budget issue. I could only give a general description of what any of the actors look like, and not just because of no closeups, but the lighting ...! Lights for outdoor shooting may cost too much, but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper! That would have required moving the camera closer to keep the reflector out of the shot, helping to solve the closeup problem at the same time. If that's too technical you can turn the actors around so they are not in shadow, or you can expose for the shadows, and if it hadn't been shot in L.A. I'd say take advantage of cloudy days.

What a day that was in cartoon history when Jessica decided to pair her Sylvester with the departed Robert Clampett's little yellow bird.",,
271,"This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life. While I like how the director, Chanwook Park, handled the revenge, the move as a whole was TERRIBLE. Oldboy is only billed at 1 hour and 55 minutes long but it feels like it takes at least 3 and a half hours to tell this story. I will say that the English dubbing was done very well and the movie was easily understandable. I felt that some of the scenes were unnecessarily long and a lot of the dialogue repeated itself. Also, if you have an aversion to annoying voices, then avoid hearing Hyejeong Kang ( she plays Mido) speak. If you are looking for a movie to kill time and make you feel morally superior to others, then watch away. If you don't want to watch a movie filled with incest, bad dialogue, unnecessary fight scenes, gross torture scenes and confusing flashbacks, then this is not the movie for you.","This movie was one of the longest movie watching experiences of my life.

273,"First: The recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax. Judging from the cover you'd think this was some kind of scandal movie about Kylie playing a character having sex, taking drugs and whatever. This is just a cheap marketscheme. She's barely in it and does neither of the things. The marketing here is unbelievable, and I'm surprised the filmmakers hasn't objected.   The movie itself was to me a huge disappointment. It seemed like a Sunset Beach episode directed sloppyhanded by a teenage Quentin Tarantino. And that s not meant as a compliment, mind you.   I think the weakness of the movie first of all is the story. It seems to be about nothing. Just about cool teenagers tripping around living ' on the edge '. The characters themselves does have some personality though, but the movie doesn't use its potential. As said, there's no story of any substance here. It seems to elaborate too much on cool dialog and ends up looking like a colorful MTV ad. It definitely has that feeling.   Still though, I guess some people might enjoy it, but I'd say there's far better movies like this around.","First: The recent campaigning of this movie is a huge hoax.

The actors did great and it was scary and made me jump. Barbara did a great job for her first film, everybody is giving her a hard time when she did great and she didn't even have that big of a role. The set was great has it was made of all wax and how it was made. The two brothers did a great job and the death sense were great. The killers were really scary and made me want to close my eyes and not look at them. I can't wait until this film comes out to Video so I can get it and see it over and over again. The over view of my review is go see this film if you like Hororr films and you will not be sorry I loved this film. I give this film a 10 out of 10 IT ROCKS!!!",,

293,"This is another of those films I can remember from when I was a kid and I recently managed to acquire it off ebay20 years on, it's nowhere near as good as I remember it being. The story is ' vaguely ' kick started, by a ' cosmic event ' ( there's another extra filmcrew member in the credits for ' weak story development ') which makes collective ants become super intelligent. Ant species who used to war with each other have ceased rivalries and are now working together. The thing I wanted to know throughout was, TO DO WHAT EXACTLY? You never find out what they want. Nigel Davenport and his sidekick travel out to the desert where bizarre ant activity has been noted, and begin to study the ants from an impregnable igloo shaped laboratory. Probably the most chilling scene in my opinion was when the two scientists visit the giant square in the crops ( like a square version of a crop circle) a result of the ants chomping away. This film was not very scary quite simply because you don't know whether to fear the ants or like them. All you know is that the ants want people to leave the area so they can get on with their hijinksbut you don't find out whether they are really baddies. It ain't a scifi because the ' cosmic event ' explanation is too vague to be properly taken into account. It is deffo more of a chiller. TBH the flares, daft hairstyles, tight shirts with big collars and Nigel Davenports unnaturally big facial hairdo freaked me out more than the ants! Did you notice that there are only six actors listed in the credits? Yup, that rightSIX, and you won't see any other human beings in this film at all. Not even in the distance! This is a plainly obviously low budget film which is a bit watchable because you probably won't have seen one like it. I can't think of any anyway. The filming of the ants is pretty good, they must have done months and months of filming before they had the shots they needed to stick in the film. You may well say to yourself ' how the Hell do they get the ants to do that? ' over and over, but it is all quite simple. You will also notice that the film makers sacrificed millions of innocent lickle ants to make the film too, so animal rights peeps STAY AWAY!

304,"Bela Lugosi is a real enigma. In the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in Dracula. Yet, again and again, he made lousy decisions regarding his career. Perhaps he had a bad agent, perhaps his drinking and drug use had a part in it or maybe he was just crazy. Regardless, he ruined his reputation by appearing in pretty much any film -- ranging from excellent horror films ( such as THE RAVEN) to bigbudget flicks ( like NINOTCHKA) to gradeZ flicks for the cheapest and shoddiest of studios. Interestingly enough, although he agreed to do this terrible film, he actually turned down the role that later went to Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN! As for this movie, it is a very silly an horridly produced WWII propaganda film that featured a dumb plot and wretched editing. Lugosi spends much of the movie murdering saboteurs -- not a bad thing at all. But at the end, we find out that he is himself a Nazi plastic surgeon and all the Americanlooking men he killed were actually Japanese!!!! The funniest part of this is during a flashback. You see Lugosi talking to a group of Japanese men before he changes them to Americanlike men. When the camera scans them, the men are clearly Asian. But, on all the other noncloseup shots, they are all VERY Western looking -- many with bald heads!! They looked absolutely NOTHING like Japanese men. I suspect the plot must have undergone a rewrite and this might account for the obvious mistake. Or, it could just be shoddy production values and editing. In fact, early in the film, they show a street scene in the city and all the cars ( circa 1942) are old Model T Fords -- obviously from stock footage!!! The bottom line is that the film is bad but also very dull. Unlike PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, it's hard to laugh at the ineptitude -- just be put to sleep by it.","<name> is a real enigma.

305,"This film gets off to a bad start. An incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantlydone, truly amazing spaceship crash. Then things go downhill again, as you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors ( apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monsterfodder.

And unfortunately, the entire thing tries to hard to be "" Crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter "" during the daylight scenes.

There is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivorbut apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes or so ... But then things take a turn. I can't exactly pinpoint the moment, but soon the movie gets a lot better. It also feels less choppedthe scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a showstealer. By the time the first monsters appear, the film is actually quite enjoyable. By the time night falls, it is great. Thrilling, horrifying and exciting.

It's fairly gritty and realistic without exploiting the characters but still it's not that interesting either and Billy Dee's character, though maltreated by white authority figures, doesn't really come off as sympathetic. It's also hurt by it's extremely low budget. Still, it's interesting to look at as it's a good depicttion of 1970s social issues.","This is a serious film about black revolutionaries and not really an action film. <name> plays a young man fed up with racism who decides to take things into <pro-his> own hands.

324,"If there's one theme of this film, it's that people can cope with hardship by having a good imagination. This family is poor, their father works graveyard, and their mother works doubleshifts, and Peter is constantly picked on for a variety of reasons, and becomes increasingly frustrated that he is often mistaken for a girl. He is just starting to approach that age of 10 or 11 where your perceptions start to change, and thinks like your appearance start to matter. The backdrop of this story is the 1967 World's Fair and the Centennial of Canada. The film's greatest moments come during the various fantasy sequences where we see just how they cope. Watch the flim, and if you've ever had a childhood friend that you dreamt with, and then for some reason, lost, you'll really like this film. Perhaps kids will like this film, but only adults will truly appreciate it, including its references to bolshevik's and what parent's will do for their children.","If there's one theme of this film, it's that people can cope with hardship by having a good imagination.

Roeg proves again it doesn't have to be a warsetting to be interressting. In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast. Ruthlessnes and beauty go hand in hand, while loneliness should become your best friend. It shows a more sinister past of a small golden age kingdom which lands on a coast full of wealth for a 1st world country, if u send the right men.

I love John Voight but I have no idea what possessed him to be a part of this travesty. The Biblical accuracy was completely nonexistent and I honestly could not stomach watching the movie with my children. My kids stood astonished because even THEY know that Lot was not even thought of when Noah was building the ark. I think that NBC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing producers to make a mockery of the Word and cause even more confusion in a world that barely knows the truth as it is ...

It is great how there are no main characters and every episode some other character(s) are the main character(s).I think the best character on the show is Vern Schillinger. He is a tough, bad guy and an Aryan on top of that which makes him a true bad guy prisoner who there are many that are known to be. This show has many murders, I think it is a little over exaggerated for the killing on the show, but I have to admit that is one of the reasons why I think the show is so great. I think some characters were killed off a little early, but some sure still made their mark. You can't compare things like Prison Break to this show, they are totally different.

I love this movie, but I recommend seeing some of John Ford's other westerns before taking a look at this one. The first time I saw it I was 18 years old and I hadn't seen too many other westerns, and I hated it. I thought it was incredibly boring. I kept waiting for something to happen. It took several years for me to love this picture. First, I fell in love with westerns in general -- the traditions, characters, landscapes, ways of talking, etc -- and that made me realize when I saw WAGONMASTER again that a lot is happening in it after all. I also was simply a more experienced moviegoer at that point and had learned to appreciate visual storytelling, and to listen to what each image was telling me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual movie by one of the most visual of directors working near the peak of his career. The movie is a celebration of a way of life, and its subject matter is more emotional and interior than other Ford westerns. Actually, that's not really as accurate as saying that, rather, it has a lot less exterior action than the other westerns. ( The other westerns have exterior action AND interior emotion.) It quite beautifully places its Mormon pioneers in the context of nature. There are many shots of animals and children -- not for any surface, narrative purpose, but for illustrating this idea. That is why the movie can be called a poem. It isn't about the surface story ( which barely exists) nearly as much as it is about an emotional idea, and it gets this idea across through composition, editing, sound and music.

So, because of its brevity, it's not really possible to compare it to more modern films. But, for its time, it's actually a very remarkable film. Much of this is because the prints were hand painted -- making Annie appear red and other colors as she does her amazing dance. I've actually seen two different versions -- one where she is red and another where she changes color throughout.

Yes, it's only 10 minutes, but it's well worth your time. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss$ 3 goodbye! Well, maybe 15 for the DVD, but you'll be real happy you did.",,

Life is not always fair and the good guys don't always win in fact I think the movie did well to reflect that especially as a teenager the pricks always did better with a lot of girls. Also it doesn't matter how nice you are you can not make someone like you. Girls/ boys like who they want to like no matter how hard you try otherwise. Sometimes you just got ta let go and say next.

I remember sitting around with mates laughing our arses off at some of the antics. The acting is not quite there compared with Fast Times at Ridgemount High but it kicks ass over this movie simply because FTARH has a lame viewer friendly ending where as this movie has a realistic ending.

Throw in my interest in what London was like back in the late 70s and you have the basic premise for my version of TV heaven! On paper the film ticked all the right boxes, and having just watched "" The Knowledge "" the actual movie itself certainly lived up to, if not exceeded, my high expectations.

As for the story and the acting, well top marks obviously go to Nigel Hawthorne as The Vampire. Absolutely brilliant! He acts deliberately unpredictably, alternating between total straightfaced severity and surreal mindgames in order to unnerve the Knowledge Boys as he puts them through test after test.

Barabara Eden went on to play "" Genie "" on T.V. Theresa was her Husband. Now that is a cool part about this film! I always enjoyed seeing real life Husband and Wife teams star in the same movie. Neat!",,
392,"I had the misfortune to watch this last night on the BBC, I expect I may have been the only viewer. From the beginning there was something quite wrong about the movie, after a few minutes of viewing i managed to work out what it was. THE MOVIE WAS BAD! Not bad in a good way like Wolfpack or a Seagal film just plain old shoddy bad. Why was this made into a movie? I've seen a few episodes of the TV series and thought it was alright but I only saw repeats of that because they made this. I spent most of the film trying to work out what the story was and by the end I was none the wiser. I seem to remember at some point a character, maybe Farina's mentions that the Mod Squad can get in to places regular cops can't. The ' place ' turns out to be a ' club ', one of the toughest places to get into, maybe it was student night? I lost track of the plot at this point or maybe there was no plot and the movie was just chopped together from various leftovers from other TV series remakes. Was it an action comedy? I don't remember any laughs. Overall this movie lacked the real scene stealing power of someone like Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy. With him Ribisi would have had somebody to bounce off.","I had the misfortune to watch this last night on the BBC, I expect I may have been the only viewer.

394,"This movie takes the plot behind the scifi flick "" Doppelganger "" ( an astronaut from our Earth crashing on a ' counterEarth ' on the opposite side of the Sun, and the Cold War totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and TV is probably better off for it. Everyone here is perfectly adequate in a ' made for TV ' way. Cameron Mitchell turns in his usual solid performance. So does Glenn Corbett ( who seems to be a kind of poor man's John Saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the ' World Order ' on counter Earth. But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this SciFi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad. I'll give one example: in the original template for this pilot, ( "" Doppleganger ""), the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence ( it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds, only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers. In "" Stranded in Space "", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound, things start shaking, and the camera blurs into a blackout ( and as a friend pointed out, it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats, the director wasn't even shaking the camera or the set). I've seen episodes of "" The Twilight Zone "" and "" The Outer Limits "" that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this madeforTV mediocrity. And that, in essence, is what's wrong with "" Stranded In Space "". No budget, no time, no imagination ... just making the token gestures and hoping the scifi Fan Boys ' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. Sorry, guys, it didn't work.   I'm sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away, and never thought of it again, except as a listing on their C.V. And that's what you, the viewer will do. You'll remember, if pressed, that you once watched a TV movie called "" Stranded In Space "", but it made no lasting impression on you, and you can't recall too much about it.","This movie takes the plot behind the scifi flick "" Doppelganger "" ( an astronaut from our Earth crashing on a ' counterEarth ' on the opposite side of the Sun, and the Cold War totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a TV series.
